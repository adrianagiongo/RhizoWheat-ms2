   abstract = {The rhizosphere competence of 15 in vitro antagonists of Rhizoctonia solani was determined 4 weeks after sowing inoculated lettuce seeds into nonsterile soil. Based on the colonization ability determined by selective plating, eight strains were selected for growth chamber experiments to determine their efficacy in controlling bottom rot caused by R. solani on lettuce. Although in the first experiment all antagonists colonized the rhizosphere of lettuce with CFU counts above 2 × 106 g-1 of root fresh weight, only four isolates significantly reduced disease severity. In subsequent experiments involving these four antagonists, only Pseudomonas jessenii RU47 showed effective and consistent disease suppression. Plate counts and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of Pseudomonas-specific gacA genes amplified from total community DNA confirmed that RU47 established as the dominant Pseudomonas population in the rhizosphere of inoculated lettuce plants. Furthermore, the DGGE fingerprint revealed that R. solani AG1-IB inoculation severely affected the bacterial and fungal community structure in the rhizosphere of lettuce and that these effects were much less pronounced in the presence of RU47. Although the exact mechanism of antagonistic activity and the ecology of RU47 remain to be further explored, our results suggest that RU47 is a promising agent to control bottom rot of lettuce. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

   abstract = {A cultivation-based approach was used to determine the in vitro antagonistic potential of soil bacteria towards Rhizoctonia solani AG3 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Foln3). Four composite soil samples were collected from four agricultural sites with previous documentation of disease suppression, located in France (FR), the Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE) and the United Kingdom (UK). Similarly, two sites from Germany (Berlin, G-BR; and Braunschweig, G-BS) without documentation of disease suppression were sampled. Total bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions from the composite soil samples onto R2A, AGS and King's B media. A total of 1,788 isolates (approximately 100 isolates per medium and site) was screened for antifungal activity, and in vitro antagonists (327 isolates) were found amongst the dominant culturable bacteria isolated from all six soils. The overall proportion of antagonists and the number of isolates with inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum were highest in three of the suppressive soils (FR, NL and SE). Characterization of antagonistic bacteria revealed a high phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Siderophore and protease activity were the most prominent phenotypic traits amongst the antagonists. The composition and diversity of antagonists in each soil was site-specific. Nevertheless, none of the antimicrobial traits of bacteria potentially contributing to soil suppressiveness analyzed in this study could be regarded as specific to a given site. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with variations in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota.The microbiota populating the rhizosphere, the interface between roots and soil, can modulate plant growth, development, and health. These microbial communities are not stochastically assembled from the surrounding soil, but their composition and putative function are controlled, at least partially, by the host plant. Here, we use the staple cereal barley as a model to gain novel insights into the impact of differential applications of nitrogen, a rate-limiting step for global crop production, on the host genetic control of the rhizosphere microbiota. Using a high-throughput amplicon sequencing survey, we determined that nitrogen availability for plant uptake is a factor promoting the selective enrichment of individual taxa in the rhizosphere of wild and domesticated barley genotypes. Shotgun sequencing and metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that this taxonomic diversification is mirrored by a functional specialization, manifested by the differential enrichment of multiple Gene Ontology terms, of the microbiota of plants exposed to nitrogen conditions limiting barley growth. Finally, a plant soil feedback experiment revealed that host control of the barley microbiota underpins the assembly of a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria putatively required to sustain plant performance under nitrogen-limiting supplies. Taken together, our observations indicate that under nitrogen conditions limiting plant growth, host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions fine-tune the host genetic selection of the barley microbiota at both taxonomic and functional levels. The disruption of these recruitment cues negatively impacts plant growth. IMPORTANCE The microbiota inhabiting the rhizosphere, the thin layer of soil surrounding plant roots, can promote the growth, development, and health of their host plants. Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with variations in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota. This is particularly evident when looking at the microbiota associated with input-demanding modern cultivated varieties and their wild relatives, which have evolved under marginal conditions. However, the functional significance of these differences remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the rhizosphere microbiota of wild and cultivated genotypes of the global crop barley and determined that nutrient conditions limiting plant growth amplify the host control on microbes at the root-soil interface. This is reflected in a plant- and genotype-dependent functional specialization of the rhizosphere microbiota, which appears to be required for optimal plant growth. These findings provide novel insights into the significance of the rhizosphere microbiota for plant growth and sustainable agriculture. },

The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of growing wheat as first and second wheat after oilseed rape, as well as monoculture in a long-term field experiment over three years on (i) aboveground biomass formation, root development and nutrient acquisition during the growing season, (ii) take-all occurrence, and (iii) grain yield and yield components. Subsoil root length density of winter wheat was significantly higher after oilseed rape as pre-crop than after wheat, which was independent of take-all occurrence. Differences in wheat aboveground biomass occurred at early growth stages and were persistent until harvest. Grain yield loss correlated well with take-all disease severity in a wet year but yield differences among crop rotational positions occurred also in a dry year without visible fungal infection. Thus, an effect of the crop rotational position of wheat beyond take-all disease pressure can be assumed. Overall, wheat root length density might be the key to understand wheat biomass formation and grain yield in different crop rotational positions.},

Different soil structural properties under winter wheat as well as total aboveground biomass of wheat grown in different crop rotational positions (monoculture, first, second and third wheat after oilseed rape) were investigated in two long-term field experiments with contrasting soil texture. At both field sites, no significant effect of the crop rotational position in any of the analyzed soil structural parameters was found. Wheat biomass in spring was on average 54% higher for wheat grown after oilseed rape compared to second and third wheat after oilseed rape or monoculture.

To address this, we investigated how plant breeding history (four wheat genotypes; two with recognized drought resistance and two without) and soil water stress history (same wheat field soil from Saskatchewan with contrasting long-term irrigation) independently or interactively influenced the response of the rhizosphere, root and leaf bacterial and fungal microbiota to short-term decreases in soil water content (SWC). We used amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria and ITS region for fungi) to characterize the wheat microbiome. Fungal and bacterial communities responses to short-term decreases in SWC were mainly constrained by soil water stress history, with some smaller, but significant influence of plant genotype. One exception was the leaf-associated fungal communities, for which the largest constraint was genotype, resulting in a clear differentiation of the communities based on the genotype's sensitivity to water stress. Our results clearly indicate that soil legacy does not only affect the response to water stress of the microbes inhabiting the soil, but also of the microorganisms more closely associated with the plant tissues, and even of the plant itself.},

   abstract = {The profound intensification of agricultural practices by increased application of agro-chemicals, short crop rotations and ploughing resulted in loss of soil fertility, erosion and accumulation of soil-borne plant pathogens. Soil microbial communities are key players in ecosystem processes and are intimately linked to crop productivity and health. Thus a better understanding of how farming practices affect soil microbiota is needed in order to promote sustainable agriculture. The long-term field trial in Bernburg (Germany) established in 1992 provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of i) the crop (maize vs. rapeseed) preceding the actual winter wheat culture, ii) tillage practice (mouldboard plough vs. cultivator tillage) and iii) standard nitrogen (N)-fertilization intensity with application of growth regulators and fungicides (intensive) compared to reduced N-fertilization without growth regulators and fungicides (extensive). We hypothesized that these different farming practices affect the soil prokaryotic community structures with consequences for their functional potential. Total community-DNA was extracted directly from soils sampled at wheat harvest. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from total community-DNA revealed a significant effect of tillage practice and the preceding crop on prokaryotic community structures, whereas the influence of N-fertilization intensity was marginal. A number of differentially abundant prokaryotic genera and their predicted functions between mouldboard plough vs. cultivator tillage as well as between different preceding crops were identified. Compared to extensive N-fertilization, intensive N-fertilization resulted in higher abundances of bacterial but not of archaeal amoA genes, that are involved in ammonia oxidation. Our data suggest that long-term farming strategies differently shape the soil prokaryotic community structure and functions, which should be considered when evaluating agricultural management strategies regarding their sustainability, soil health and crop performance.},

We review the role of rotations in the development and preservation of soil structure. After first introducing the types of rotations in current practice and their impact on yield, we assess how soil and crop management in rotations determines soil structure, and in turn how soil structure influences crop growth and yield. We also briefly consider how soil structure might contribute to other beneficial effects of rotations, namely nutrient cycling and disease suppression. Emphasis is given to the influence of crop choice and, where relevant, interaction with tillage system and avoidance of compaction in the improvement and maintenance of soil structure. Crop rotations profoundly modify the soil environment. The sequence of crops in rotation not only influences the removal of nutrients from a soil, but also the return of crop residues, the development and distribution of biopores and the dynamics of microbial communities. These processes contribute to the development of soil structure. We have identified areas where further research is needed to enable the potential benefits of rotations in the management of soil structure to be fully exploited. These include: improved quantitative linkages between soil structure and crop growth, the consequences to soil structure and nutrient cycling of crop residue incorporation, developing natural disease suppression, amelioration of subsoils by crop roots, the fate of carbon deposited by plant roots in soil and the fate of organic nitrogen in soil.},

   abstract = {Background: One promise of the recently presented microbiome definition suggested that, in combination with unifying concepts and standards, microbiome research could be important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in various microbiota. With this commentary we want to further elaborate this suggestion, because we noticed specific signatures in microbiota affected by the Anthropocene. Results: Here, we discuss this based on a review of available literature and our own research targeting exemplarily the plant microbiome. It is not only crucial for plants themselves but also linked to planetary health. We suggest that different human activities are commonly linked to a shift of diversity and evenness of the plant microbiota, which is also characterized by a decrease of host specificity, and an increase of r-strategic microbes, pathogens, and hypermutators. The resistome, anchored in the microbiome, follows this shift by an increase of specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms as well as an increase of plasmid-associated resistance genes. This typical microbiome signature of the Anthropocene is often associated with dysbiosis and loss of resilience, and leads to frequent pathogen outbreaks. Although several of these observations are already confirmed by meta-studies, this issue requires more attention in upcoming microbiome studies. Conclusions: Our commentary aims to inspire holistic studies for the development of solutions to restore and save microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning as well as the closely connected planetary health.

Methods and Results: Sixty randomly chosen antagonistic bacterial strains originally isolated from rhizosphere of three different host plants of V. dahliae - strawberry, potato and oilseed rape - were evaluated for biocontrol and plant growth promotion by analysing in vitro antagonism towards V. dahliae and other plant pathogenic fungi, production of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes and plant growth-promoting effects on strawberry seedlings. To test the plant growth-promoting effect, a microplate assay with strawberry seedlings was developed. Although the rhizobacterial strains were isolated from different plants they showed effects on the growth of strawberry seedlings. According to the in vitro biocontrol and plant growth-promoting activity, the three best candidates Pseudomonas putida B E2 (strawberry rhizosphere), Ps. chlororaphis K15 (potato rhizosphere) and Serratia plymuthica R12 (oilseed rape rhizosphere) were selected for greenhouse experiments to verify the in vitro screening results. Under greenhouse conditions the isolates selected according to this strategy were as effective, or more effective than commercial biocontrol agents and may therefore possibly be valuable as antagonists of V. dahliae. Conclusions: In this study, the screening strategy resulted in a selection of three interesting biocontrol candidates against Verticillium: Ps. putida B E2 (strawberry rhizosphere), Ps. chlororaphis K15 (potato rhizosphere) and Ser. plymuthica R12 (oilseed rape rhizosphere).

In contrast, in situ effects of inoculants, and especially their impact on the plant indigenous microbiome was mostly neglected so far. Recently, microbiome research has revolutionized our understanding of plants as coevolved holobionts but also of indigenous microbiome-inoculant interactions. Here we disentangle the effects of microbial inoculants on the indigenous plant microbiome and point out the following types of plant microbiome modulations: (i) transient microbiome shifts, (ii) stabilization or increase of microbial diversity, (iii) stabilization or increase of plant microbiome evenness, (iv) restoration of a dysbiosis/compensation or reduction of a pathogen-induced shift, (v) targeted shifts toward plant beneficial members of the indigenous microbiota, and (vi) suppression of potential pathogens.

The current study used a molecular method to quantify soil G. graminis var. tritici concentrations in commercial wheat fields in New Zealand and to compare them with the proportion of crops surpassing the thresholds for visible and moderate to severe take-all over three growing seasons. The study evaluated a soil G. graminis var. tritici DNA-based take-all prediction system developed in Australia, with four take-all risk categories. These categories were found to be useful for predicting disease severity in second wheat but did not clearly separate risk between fields in medium- and high-risk categories. A sigmoidal relationship was identified between inoculum concentration and the proportion of fields exceeding the two disease thresholds. A logistic response curve was used to further examine this relationship and evaluate the boundaries between take-all risk categories. G. graminis var. tritici boundaries between medium- and high-risk categories were clustered near or within the upper plateau of the relationship. Alternative G. graminis var. tritici boundaries for a three-category system were identified that provided better separation of take-all risk between categories.

The chitinolytic activity was induced when the strains were grown in the presence of colloidal chitin as the sole carbon source. It was quantitated by using assays with chromogenic p-nitrophenyl analogs of disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide derivatives of N-acetylglucosamine. A set of three fluorescent substrates with a 4-methylum-belliferyl group linked by-1,4 linkage to N-acetylglucosamine mono-or oligosaccharides were used to identify the chitinolytic activities of proteins which had been renatured following their separation by electrophoresis. This study provides the most complete evidence for the presence of a complex of chitinolytic enzymes in Enterobacter strains. Four enzymes were detected: two N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidases of 89 and 67 kDa, an endochitinase with an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa, and a chitobiosidase of 50 kDa. The biocontrol ability of the chitinolytic strains was demonstrated under greenhouse conditions. The bacteria decreased the incidence of disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani in cotton by 64 to 86%. Two Tn5 mutants of one of the isolates, which were deficient in chitinolytic activity, were unable to protect plants against the disease. Various strains of Enterobacter spp. have been described as being effective biological control agents antagonistic to many fungal phytopathogens. Several isolates of Enterobacter cloacae are known to be biocontrol agents for different rots and preemergence damping-off of pea, beet, cotton, and cucumber plants incited by Pythium spp., as well as of Fusarium wilt of cucumber and some other plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens (7, 22, 35). Enterobacter aerogenes B8 significantly reduced infections of apple crown and root rot caused by Phytophtora cactorum (38). Some strains of Enterobacter agglo-merans were shown to be efficient in the control of plant diseases caused by different bacterial and fungal pathogens (10, 22, 27). Various traits expressed synchronously or in a controlled sequence are considered responsible for the action of these strains as biological control agents (24). The ability to produce an antibiotic-like substance was found in strain E. aerogenes B8 (39). Strains of E. cloacae and E. agglomerans were found to produce hydroxamate siderophores (2, 16) and different volatile and nonvolatile antifungal metabolites (11, 37). Competition for nutrients and rhizosphere colonization ability were considered possible mechanisms of antifungal activity in E. cloacae (40) and E. agglomerans (10), respectively. Although some strains of Enterobacter spp. suppress many fungal plant pathogens, data pertaining to the chitinolytic activity of these bacteria are still restricted to only one strain of E. cloacae, and these data are rather inconsistent (17, 29). It is well known, however, that chitin, an insoluble linear polymer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a-1,4 linkage, is a major structural component of most fungal cell walls, and that many species of bacteria, streptomycetes, actinomycetes, fungi, and plants produce chitinolytic enzymes (21, 32). Bacteria from the genera Aeromonas (12) and Serratia (26) and fungi from the genera Gliocladium (4) and Trichoderma (5), all of which produce chitinolytic enzymes, have been shown to be potential agents for the biological control of plant diseases caused by various phytopathogenic fungi. Evidence that these enzymes are responsible for that effect has been presented (18, 33). Attachment to fungal hyphae was considered an important mechanism in the biocontrol activity of E. cloacae strains against Pythium ultimum (23), and the stimulation of this binding by chitinolytic enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum was demonstrated (17). In the present work, we found that three soil-borne strains of E. agglomerans, which are antagonists of many phytopatho-genic fungi, possess strong chitinolytic activity. The strains were isolated in the course of a screening program for rhizo-spheric bacteria exhibiting a broad range of antagonism toward microbial phytopathogens (3). These strains were found to produce and excrete a complex of chitinolytic enzymes, which were resolved and partially characterized. The role of the chiti-nolytic enzymes in suppressing fungal phytopathogens was studied by using Rhizoctonia solani in cotton as a model, comparing natural isolates with mutants deficient in chitinolytic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cultures and growth media. The three strains of bacteria used in this work (IC960, IC993, and IC1270) were independently isolated from the rhizosphere of different grape bushes in vineyards in the Samarkand region (Republic of Uzbekistan). The isolates were identified as Enterobacter (Pantoea) agglomerans by microbiological and biochemical tests and by gas chromatographic analysis of the whole-cell fatty acid methyl esters. The identification was performed independently in the Bacterial Division of the All-Russia Collection of Microorganisms (Puschino, Moscow Region, Russia) and in the Department of Plant Pathology , Auburn University. The strains were found to produce as yet unidentified antibiotic-like substances and to exhibit proteolytic activity (our unpublished observation).

   abstract = {Background and aims: Take-all, caused by the soilborne pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, (Ggt), is an important root disease of wheat. Continuous wheat cropping has been shown to induce take-all decline (TAD). This research investigated the mechanisms of TAD in 13 New Zealand soils in two experiments and identified the associated microorganisms using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Methods: In Experiment 1, a sterile sand/maize-meal mixture inoculated or not inoculated with Ggt, was added at 4 % (w/w) to sterilised and non-sterilised soils to determine their ability to suppress take-all, and to help identify the nature of suppression. Experiment 2 investigated the transferability of suppressive properties in five of the soils from Experiment 1. The microbial communities of these five soils were analysed using PCR-DGGE. Results: Ten of the soils were able to suppress take-all but the suppression was biological in nature in only four of these soils. The suppressive properties of two of the soils were transferred to a γ-irradiated base soil amended with Ggt, indicating that suppression could be specific in nature (i.e., attributed to a specific microorganism or group of microorganisms). The suppressive properties in one soil were not transferrable, suggesting a general form of suppression, most probably because the conditions in the soil were suitable for other microorganisms to compete with Ggt. DGGE analyses of the microbial communities for five of the soils showed similar banding patterns for those with similar forms of suppression (specific, general and non-suppressive) and identified the potential microorganisms that distinguished them. Conclusion: These distinguishing microorganisms are likely to independently or interactively have a function in suppressing take-all.},

Their functions range from mutualism to pathogenicity. All plant organs and tissues are generally colonized by bacterial endophytes and their diversity and composition depend on the plant, the plant organ and its physiological conditions, the plant growth stage as well as on the environment. Plant-associated microorganisms, and in particular endophytes, have lately received high attention, because of the increasing awareness of the importance of host-associated microbiota for the functioning and performance of their host. Some endophyte functions are known from mostly lab assays, genome prediction and few metagenome analyses; however, we have limited understanding on in planta activities, particularly considering the diversity of micro-environments and the dynamics of conditions. In our review, we present recent findings on endosphere environments, their physiological conditions and endophyte colonization. Furthermore, we discuss microbial functions, the interaction between endophytes and plants as well as methodological limitations of endophyte research. We also provide an outlook on needs of future research to improve our understanding on the role of microbiota colonizing the endosphere on plant traits and ecosystem functioning.},

A considerable amount of information is now available on the structure and dynamics of plant microbiota as well as on the functional capacities of isolated community members. Due to the interesting functional potential of plant microbiota as well as due to current challenges in crop production there is an urgent need to bring microbial innovations into practice. Different approaches for microbiome improvement exist. On the one hand microbial strains or strain combinations can be applied, however, field success is often variable and improvement is urgently required. Smart, knowledge-driven selection of microorganisms is needed as well as the use of suitable delivery approaches and formulations. On the other hand, farming practices or the plant genotype can influence plant microbiota and thus functioning. Therefore, selection of appropriate farming practices and plant breeding leading to improved plant-microbiome interactions are avenues to increase the benefit of plant microbiota. In conclusion, different avenues making use of a new generation of inoculants as well as the application of microbiome-based agro-management practices and improved plant lines could lead to a better use of the plant microbiome. This paper reviews the importance and functionalities of the bacterial plant microbiome and discusses challenges and concepts in regard to the application of plant-associated bacteria.},

   abstract = {Take-all, caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is arguably the most-studied root disease of any crop, yet remains the most important root disease of wheat worldwide. S. D. Garrett launched the study of root diseases and soilborne pathogens as an independent field of science starting in the middle of the 20th century, inspired by and based in large part on his research on take-all during the first half of the 20th century. Because there has been neither a source of host plant resistance nor an effective and economical fungicide for use against this disease, the focus for nearly a century has been on cultural and biological controls. In spite of the intensive and extensive works towards these controls, with mostly site-or soil-specific success, the only broadly and consistently effective controls require either crop rotation (break crops), or the converse, wheat monoculture to induce take-all decline. Take-all decline has become the model system for research on biological control of plant pathogens in the rhizosphere and provided the first proof to the scientific world after decades of debate that antibiotics are both produced in soils and play a role in the ecology of soil microorganisms. On the other hand, even the best yields following take-all decline are rarely equal to those achieved with crop rotation. Because of this, the continuing trends globally to shorten rather than lengthen the rotations in wheat-based cropping systems, and the growing use of direct-seed (no-till) trashy systems to reduce costs and protect soil and water resources, new methods to control take-all are needed more than ever. With high resolution maps of the genomes of cereals and other grasses now available, including a complete sequence of the rice genome, and the interesting differences as well as striking similarities among the genomes of cereals and related grasses, gene transfer to wheat from oats, rice, maize and other grass species resistant to G. graminis var. tritici should be pursued. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Grapevine decline affects viticulture worldwide. It is caused by a wide range of individual and combined biotic and abiotic factors. Some declines remain unexplained because they are not associated with known pathological symptoms or mineral dysregulation. Vineyard microbiological quality is an important area of study, since grapevine-associated microbiome primarily originates in vineyard soils and determines host health and development. To understand the decrease of growth and yield, and the high mortality of plants in vineyards affected by these declines, a multisite study investigated soil microbial communities. Spatial (terroir: two distinct geographical locations) and temporal (season: autumn and spring) dimensions were added to the inter-row soil status factor (S for areas with symptomatic vines and AS for those with asymptomatic vines). The microbiomes of AS and S soils were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, the fungal ITS1 region (Internal Transcribed Spacer), or the fungal 18S rRNA gene for Glomeromycota family. Geographical location was the strongest driver of bacterial and fungal microbial communities, while the seasonal factor primarily influenced bacterial community. Based on metabarcoding analysis, symptomatic soils presented enriched bacterial taxa that can be potentially beneficial for grapevine growth. In addition, fungal diversity and richness, including Glomeromycota division, were greater in symptomatic soils. Fungal genera associated with grapevine diseases were detected across all conditions, with higher abundances in symptomatic soils. These findings reveal that vineyard soils affected by unexplained decline are a potential source of both fungal pathogens and beneficial microorganisms.},

Within this context, soil inoculation with PGPB (Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria) may be considered a promising tool of integrated management systems.

PGPB comprise different functional and taxonomic groups of bacteria like Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhizobium and others. Their ability to either mobilize mineral or organic bound nutrients from the pedosphere or to fix atmospheric N2 and make it available to the plants, is a crucial feature in their application. In literature some data are available on the use of commercial PGPB, while less efforts have been made on the study of the effect of autochthonous PGPB isolated from soils on sustainability of cropping systems; thus a literature survey on these aspects was carried out with special focus on wheat, a staple food for a large part of world population. In particular, the main topic of this review is the potential of PGPB to enhance use efficiency of agro-environmental resources focusing on the interaction PGPB-wheat for improving nitrogen use efficiency.},

   abstract = {Many studies in soil microbial ecology are undertaken with a single sampling event, with the influence of temporal progression rarely being considered. Under field conditions, soil samples were taken from different agricultural systems; a sown grassland to maize rotation (MC), an intensively managed permanent grassland (INT), as well as extensively managed permanent grasslands with high (EXT_HP), low to sufficient (EXT_LP) and deficient available P (EXT_DP), six times throughout the 2017 growing season. Thus, this study aimed to determine if any differences in soil microbiome structures between both sharply contrasting (MC – INT – EXT), slightly differing (EXT_HP – EXT_DP) and quite similar (EXT_HP – EXT_LP and EXT_LP – EXT_DP) agricultural systems persist through changing growth conditions within the growing season. For both fungal and bacterial community structure, the influence of agricultural system (CV = 0.256, P < 0.001 and CV = 0.145, P < 0.01, respectively) was much greater than that of temporal progression (√CV = 0.065 and 0.042, respectively, both P < 0.001). Importantly, nearly all agricultural systems persistently harbored significantly distinct fungal community structures across each of the six sampling events (all at least P < 0.05). There were not as many pairwise differences in bacterial community structure between the agricultural systems, but some did persist (MC and EXT_HP ∼ EXT_DP, all P < 0.001). Additionally, persistent indicator fungal OTUs (IndVal >0.7, P ≤ 0.05) associated to each agricultural system (except EXT_LP) were found in each of the six sampling events. These results highlight the temporal stability of pairwise differences in soil microbiome structures between established agricultural systems through changing plant growth conditions, even between those with a comparable management regime. This is a highly relevant finding in informing the sampling strategy of studies in soil microbial ecology as well as for designing efficient soil biodiversity monitoring systems.},

To understand how the composition of the wheat and its ancestral species microbiome have changed over the evolutionary processes, we performed a 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis on rhizobacterial communities associated with a phylogenetic framework of four Triticum species T. urartu, T. turgidum, T. durum, and T. aestivum along with their ancestral species Aegilops speltoides, and Ae. tauschii during vegetative and reproductive stages. Results: In this study, we illustrated that the genome contents of wild species Aegilops speltoides and Ae. tauschii can be significant factors determining the composition of root-associated bacterial communities in domesticated bread wheat. Although it was found that domestication and modern breeding practices might have had a significant impact on microbiome-plant interactions especially at the reproductive stage, we observed an extensive and selective control by wheat genotypes on associated rhizobacterial communities at the same time. Our data also showed a strong genotypic variation within species of T. aestivum and Ae. tauschii, suggesting potential breeding targets for plants surveyed. Conclusions: This study performed with different genotypes of Triticum and Aegilops species is the first study showing that the genome contents of Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii along with domestication-related changes can be significant factors determining the composition of root-associated bacterial communities in bread wheat. It is also indirect evidence that shows a very extensive range of host traits and genes are probably involved in host-microbe interactions. Therefore, understanding the wheat root-associated microbiome needs to take into consideration of its polygenetic mosaic nature.},

   abstract = { The plethora of microorganisms inhabiting the immediate vicinity of healthy root systems plays a pivotal role in facilitating optimal nutrient and water acquisition by plants. In this study, we investigated the soil microbial communities associated with wheat roots within distinct microhabitats, root-affected soil (RA), rhizosphere (RH), and rhizoplane (RP). These microhabitats were explored at five soil depths, and our investigation focused on wheat cultivated in a monoculture (WM) and wheat crop rotation (WR). Overall, there were significant differences in microbiota composition between WM and WR, although no difference in bacterial diversity was observed. Differentially abundant taxa between WM and WR were observed in all three microhabitats, emphasizing important insights on the localization of commonly associated bacteria to wheat roots. Comparing the microhabitats, RP exhibited the most dissimilar microbial composition between WM and WR. Taxa that were differentially abundant between WM and WR were observed in the three microhabitats. The high relative abundance of taxa belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria in the rhizoplane, such as Devosia , Pseudomonas , Shinella , and Sphingomonas , along with other genera, such as Pedobacter ( Bacteroidota ), Agromyces and Streptomyces ( Actinobacteriota ) highlight the recruitment of potentially beneficial bacterial taxa to the vicinity of the roots. Interestingly, these taxa were observed along the entire length of wheat roots, even at depths of up to 120 cm. The presence of specific taxa associated with wheat roots at all soil depths may be beneficial for coping with nutrient and water shortages, particularly under upcoming climate scenarios, where water may be a limiting factor for plant growth. This study provides valuable insights for designing management strategies to promote a diverse and healthy microbial community in wheat cropping systems, considering soil depth and microhabitats as key factors. Although, at this time, we cannot link specific bacterial taxa to yield reductions commonly observed in monocultural fields, we propose that some genera may enhance plant nutrient or water acquisition in rotation compared with monoculture. Advanced technologies, including functional analyses and culturomics, may further enhance our understanding of the ecological roles played by these microbes and their potential applications in sustainable agriculture. },

   abstract = {A group-specific primer, F243 (positions 226 to 243, Escherichia coli numbering), was developed by comparison of sequences of genes encoding 16S rRNA (16S rDNA) for the detection of actinomycetes in the environment with PCR and temperature or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE or DGGE, respectively). The specificity of the forward primer in combination with different reverse ones was tested with genomic DNA from a variety of bacterial strains. Most actinomycetes investigated could be separated by TGGE and DGGE, with both techniques giving similar results. Two strategies were employed to study natural microbial communities. First, we used the selective amplification of actinomycete sequences (E. coli positions 226 to 528) for direct analysis of the products in denaturing gradients. Second, a nested PCR providing actinomycete-specific fragments (E. coli positions 226 to 1401) was used which served as template for a PCR when conserved primers were used. The products (E. coli positions 968 to 1401) of this indirect approach were then separated by use of gradient gels. Both approaches allowed detection of actinomycete communities in soil. The second strategy allowed the estimation of the relative abundance of actinomycetes within the bacterial community. Mixtures of PCR-derived 16S rDNA fragments were used as model communities consisting of five actinomycetes and five other bacterial species. Actinomycete products were obtained over a 100-fold dilution range of the actinomycete DNA in the model community by specific PCR; detection of the diluted actinomycete DNA was not possible when conserved primers were used. The methods tested for detection were applied to monitor actinomycete community changes in potato rhizosphere and to investigate actinomycete diversity in different soils.},

There is broad consensus that microorganisms-with their abilities to alleviate biotic and abiotic stresses and to improve plant nutrition-offer countless opportunities to enhance plant productivity and to ameliorate agricultural sustainability. However, microbe-assisted cultivation approaches face challenges that need to be addressed before a breakthrough of such technologies can be expected. Following up on the miCROPe symposium and a linked satellite workshop on breeding for beneficial plant-microbe interactions, we carved out research priorities towards successful implementation of microbiome knowledge for modern agriculture. These include (i) to solve context dependency for microbial inoculation approaches and (ii) to identify the genetic determinants to allow breeding for beneficial plant-microbiome interactions. With the combination of emerging third generation sequencing technologies and new causal research approaches, we now stand at the crossroad of utilising microbe-assisted crop production as a reliable and sustainable agronomic practice.},

It is well known that a multitude of microbes interact with eukaryotic organisms, including plants, and the sum of microbes and their functions associated with a given host is termed the microbiome. Plant-microbe interactions can be beneficial, neutral or harmful to the host plant. Over the last decade, with the development of next generation DNA sequencing technology, our understanding of the plant microbiome structure has dramatically increased. Considering that defining the wheat microbiome is key to leverage crop production in a sustainable way, here we describe how different factors drive microbiome assembly in wheat, including crop management, edaphic-environmental conditions and host selection. In addition, we highlight the benefits to take a multidisciplinary approach to define and explore the wheat core microbiome to generate solutions based on microbial (synthetic) communities or single inoculants. Advances in plant microbiome research will facilitate the development of microbial strategies to guarantee a sustainable intensification of crop production.},

   abstract = {The impacts of broadleaf crop, pasture or fallow breaks within cereal-based cropping systems are widely acknowledged, but most studies have focussed on the first cereal crop after the break. We report a series of four field experiments in a semi-arid cropping zone of Southern Australia in which the impacts of a range of Year 1 sequence options (crops, pasture and fallow) on Year 3 and 4 wheat crops were investigated. In three of the experiments, two phases of the same experiment were commenced in successive years, providing seven sequence phases. In three of the seven phases (at three of the four sites), the Year 1 treatments influenced the yield of Year 3 or Year 4 wheat crops by 0.6, 0.9 and 0.9tha-1, although different responses between phases of the same experiments at two sites provided clear evidence of significant seasonal interactions. Interactions of Year 1 sequence treatments with tillage, crop species/varieties and/or added P-fertiliser treatments in intervening years also occurred at some sites. The largest persistent yield impacts related to the preservation of differences in residual nitrogen (N), and in some cases water following Year 1 crops through subsequent dry seasons, which were frequent in most experimental phases. Higher residual N levels after legumes and canola could persist for 2-3 years and induce yield penalties due to "haying-off" when Year 3 or 4 wheat crops experienced dry spring conditions. Such effects were offset following Year 1 fallow due to increased residual water at depth. Increases in the cereal root diseases take-all (Gaeumannomyces tritici) and rhizoctonia (Rhizoctonia solani AG8) due to Year 1 wheat also persisted through dry seasons and reduced Year 3 wheat yield in some experiments. We found no evidence for a significant role for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in yield of Year 3 and 4 wheat crops. We demonstrate that large and significant yield impacts (>0.5tha-1), both positive and negative, can persist for 3-4 years in semi-arid environments as a result of water, N and disease inoculum legacies of Year 1 crop sequence choices. Prolonged dry periods help to preserve these legacies, so that persistent and unpredictable crop sequence effects will be a feature of cropping systems in semi-arid areas with variable climates. © 2014 .},

   abstract = {In Europe, the framework for sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production was subject to considerable changes and for the future it is expected that sugar beet cultivation might concentrate around the sugar factories for economic reasons. Based on data from a national sugar beet farmers’ survey and multi-year crop rotation trials, the effects of cropping interval (number of years in between two subsequent sugar beet crops) and of preceding crops on sugar yield were elucidated under current Central European management conditions. The dominating sugar beet cropping interval was ≥4 years in the farm survey with pronounced differences between regions. However, the cropping intervals 2, 3, and ≥4 years did not affect the sugar yield. Therefore, significant differences in sugar yield between regions were assumed to be caused by multiple interactions between year, site, and farmers’ skills. Throughout Germany, the dominating preceding crops in sugar beet cultivation were winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). In the field trials, the sugar yield was 5% higher after pea (Pisum sativum L.) compared to maize (Zea mays L.) as preceding crop, while differences between the preceding crops pea and winter wheat, and wheat and maize were not significant. Repeated measurements of canopy development and leaf color during the growing season revealed a higher N-availability after pea as preceding crop. However, decreased growth after maize was not completely compensated for by high N-fertilizer doses. Overall, the causes for the differences in sugar yield between the preceding crops remained open. The results do not support concerns about substantial yield losses in sugar beet production due to a reduction in the cropping interval from 3 to 2 years. Nevertheless, short rotations with maize and sugar beet might increase the risk of Rhizoctonia solani crown and root rot infestation. Leguminous crops such as pea offer the potential for higher sugar beet yield with lower N-fertilizer doses.},

   abstract = {Microbial inoculants have gained increasing attention worldwide as an eco-friendly solution for improving agriculture productivity. Several studies have demonstrated their potential benefits, such as enhanced resistance to drought, salinity, and pathogens. However, the beneficial impacts of inoculants remain inconsistent. This variability is attributed to limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which microbial inoculants affect crop growth and a lack of ecological characteristics of these inoculants that limit our ability to predict their beneficial effects. The first important step is believed to be the evaluation of the inoculant's ability to colonize new habitats (soils and plant roots), which could provide crops with beneficial functions and improve the consistency and efficiency of the inoculants. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of three microbial inoculants (two bacterial: P1 and P2, and one fungal: P3) on the growth and stress responses of three wheat varieties in two different soil types under drought conditions. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of microbial inoculants on soil microbial communities. Plant biomass and traits were measured, and high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize bulk and rhizosphere soil microbiomes after exposure to drought stress. Under drought conditions, plant shoot weight significantly increased (11.37%) under P1 treatments compared to uninoculated controls. In addition, total nitrogen enzyme activity increased significantly under P1 in sandy soil but not in clay soil. Importantly, network analyses revealed that P1, consisting of Bacillus paralicheniformis and Bacillus subtilis, emerged as the keystone taxa in sandy soil. Conversely, P2 and P3 failed to establish as keystone taxa, which may explain their insignificant impact on wheat performance under drought conditions. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the importance of effective colonization by microbial inoculants in promoting crop growth under drought conditions. Our findings support the development of microbial inoculants that robustly colonize plant roots for improved agricultural productivity.},

This study aimed to elucidate whether ARD is systemic, i.e. whether the contact of parts of the root system with ARD soil causes the whole plant to show poor shoot and root growth. A split-root experiment was conducted with seedlings of 'M26', offering the same plant for its root system the choice between the substrates ARD soil (+ARD), γ-sterilized ARD soil (-ARD) or soil from a grass parcel (Control) with the following combinations: +ARD/+ARD,-ARD/-ARD; +ARD/-ARD; +ARD/Control. Root growth was analysed throughout the 34-day growing period. Samples from bulk, rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil were collected separately for each compartment, and analysed by fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene or ITS fragments amplified from total community (TC) DNA. The response of the plant to +ARD was not systemic as root growth in-ARD compartment was always superior to root growth in +ARD soil. Crosswise 15N-labelling of the N-fertilizer applied to the split-root compartments showed that nitrate-N uptake efficiency was higher for roots in-ARD soil compared to those in +ARD. Bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of the same plants differed significantly between the compartments containing +ARD/-ARD or +ARD/Control. The strongest differences between the bacterial fingerprints were observed in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere. Bacterial genera with increased abundance in response to ARD were mainly Streptomyces but also Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Rhizobium, Lysobacter and Variovorax. The strongest differences between the fungal fingerprints were observed in bulk soil. Our data showed that the response of the apple plant to ARD soil is local and not systemic.},

Glyphosate reduced the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in W–W rotation but increased it in P–W rotation, and it reduced the relative abundance of Opitutus spp. The W–W rotation had greater relative abundances of the classes Bacilli (Firmicutes) and Gammaproteobacteria, and genera Bacillus and Opitutus (Verrucomicrobia), than the P–W rotation. Compared with MT, NT increased the relative abundance of the phylum candidate division WPS-1, but it reduced that of Phenylobacterium spp. in W–W rotation.

However, this point is often expressed vaguely, suggesting that some scientists have different interpretations of the paradigm. In addition, there have been substantial advances in cultivation techniques suggesting that this paradigm may no longer be correct. To quantify bacterial culturability across six major biomes, I found that the median 16S rRNA similarity of bacteria to known cultured relatives was 97.3 ± 2.3% (s.d.). Furthermore, 52.0 ± 24% of sequences and 34.9 ± 23% of taxa (defined as >97% similar) had a closely related cultured relative. Thus, many cells and taxa across environments are culturable with known techniques, suggesting that the 1% paradigm is no longer correct.},

   abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Development of a robust bacterial taxonomy has been hindered by an inability to obtain most bacteria in pure culture and, to a lesser extent, by the historical use of phenotypes to guide classification. Culture-independent sequencing technologies have matured sufficiently that a comprehensive genome-based taxonomy is now possible. We used a concatenated protein phylogeny as the basis for a bacterial taxonomy that conservatively removes polyphyletic groups and normalizes taxonomic ranks on the basis of relative evolutionary divergence. Under this approach, 58% of the 94,759 genomes comprising the Genome Taxonomy Database had changes to their existing taxonomy. This result includes the description of 99 phyla, including six major monophyletic units from the subdivision of the Proteobacteria, and amalgamation of the Candidate Phyla Radiation into a single phylum.

   abstract = {Bacterial wilt (BW) disease causes huge economic loss. Heretofore there is no effective way to completely control BW. Here, cover crops (pea, rapeseed, and wheat) were used to restore declining soil properties and control BW. Cover crops can increase content of soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen and enzymatic activities, as well as suppress BW. Different kinds of cover crops are distinguished in recovering different soil properties. For instance, rapeseed can inhibit BW more effectively than wheat and pea, while wheat has the best effect on increasing soil organic matter, urease, and invertase. Nevertheless, pea improves catalase better than rapeseed and wheat. Moreover, relative abundance of plant-beneficial bacteria in cover crop treatments is higher than that in the control, with a negative correlation with disease index. For example, wheat has the best effect on improving the growth of plant-beneficial bacteria, followed by rapeseed. The bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling are enriched in pea treatments. However, the relative abundance of pathogen and denitrifying bacteria in cover crop treatments is lower than that in the control, with a positive correlation with disease index. The count of bacteria genes involved in nutrients cycling, antibiotics synthesis, and biodegradation of toxic compounds in cover crop treatments is higher than that in the control. Wheat includes more these genes than rapeseed and pea. Overall, cover crops can restore declining soil properties and suppress BW by increasing soil nutrients and beneficial bacteria as well as decreasing pathogen. Among all cover crops, wheat is considered as the optimal one.},

Rather than identifying, testing and applying potential biocontrol agents in an inundative fashion, research into suppressive soils has attempted to understand how indigenous microbiomes can reduce disease, even in the presence of the pathogen, susceptible host, and favorable environment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing of microbiomes have provided new tools to reexamine and further characterize the nature of these soils. Two general types of suppression have been described: specific and general suppression, and theories have been developed around these two models. In this review, we will present three examples of currently-studied model systems with features representative of specific and general suppressiveness: suppression to take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), Rhizoctonia bare patch of wheat (Rhizoctonia solani AG-8), and Streptomyces. To compare and contrast the two models of general versus specific suppression, we propose a number of hypotheses about the nature and ecology of microbial populations and communities of suppressive soils. We outline the potential and limitations of new molecular techniques that can provide novel ways of testing these hypotheses. Finally, we consider how this greater understanding of the phytobiome can facilitate sustainable disease management in agriculture by harnessing the potential of indigenous soil microbes.},

   abstract = {In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based cropping systems, rotation crops often provide a yield benefit to the following wheat crop. This has been documented for legume crops and canola (Brassica napus L.). In the present study, we examined bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of wheat and canola at six paired locations on fall and spring sampling dates using high-throughput sequencing of marker genes (bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacers). Soil type was the primary driver of both fungal and bacterial communities, with the communities of locations geographically closest, and with the same soil type, clustering together. Season (fall vs spring sampling) had the next strongest effect, followed by the crop species. Differences between the wheat and canola were more evident in the spring than in the fall. However, in contrast, bacterial and fungal species richness and diversity were not related to location or season, and instead were consistently higher in the rhizosphere of canola compared to wheat. Many bacterial groups were shared across both crop species, especially Janthinobacterium and Kaistobacter. Bacterial communities of wheat in the fall were dominated by Actinomycetes and Acidobacteria. But in the spring, these communities shifted to fast growing bacterial copiotrophs, including Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Oxalobacteraceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae. Saprotrophic fungi such as Ulocladium, Mortierella, Cryptoccocus, Chaetomium, Penicillium and Trichoderma were also common to, and equally abundant in, the rhizosphere of both crops. Potential wheat root pathogens such as Thanatephorus (Rhizoctonia) Ceratobasidium, Oculimacula, Typhula, and Microdochium were more abundant in the wheat rhizosphere compared to canola. In conclusion, most of the communities of fungi and bacteria are not “host specific” but colonize the roots of both wheat and canola with differing relative abundance dependent on the season. A much smaller group of taxa were unique to the specific crop. This work provides novel insight into changes in crop rhizosphere communities when canola is introduced into dryland monoculture wheat cropping systems.},

   abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities, despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on fitness differences and resource overlap between individual colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R). Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution, resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating that the leaf’s spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments and a framework to predict competition outcomes.

Two independent experiments were carried out in 2011 on an experimental plot system with three soil types sharing the same cropping history and weather conditions for more than 10 years. Rifampicin resistant mutants of the inoculants were used to evaluate their colonization in the rhizosphere of lettuce. The rhizosphere bacterial community structure was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community DNA to get insights into the effects of the inoculants and R. solani on the indigenous rhizosphere bacterial communities. Both inoculants showed a good colonization ability of the rhizosphere of lettuce with more than 106 colony forming units per g root dry mass two weeks after planting. An effect of the soil type on rhizosphere competence was observed for 3Re4-18 but not for RU47. In both experiments a comparable rhizosphere competence was observed and in the presence of the inoculants disease symptoms were either significantly reduced, or at least a non-significant trend was shown. Disease severity was highest in diluvial sand followed by alluvial loam and loess loam suggesting that the soil types differed in their conduciveness for bottom rot disease. Compared to effect of the soil type of the rhizosphere bacterial communities, the effects of the pathogen and the inoculants were less pronounced. The soil types had a surprisingly low influence on rhizosphere competence and biocontrol activity while they significantly affected the bottom rot disease severity. © 2014 Schreiter et al.},

When a strong chelator removes the iron from the dye, its color turns from blue to orange. Because of the high sensitivity, determination of siderophores in solution and their characterization by paper electrophoresis chromatography can be performed directly on supematants of culture fluids. The method is also applicable to agar plates. Grange halos around the colonies on blue agar are indicative of siderophore excretion. It was demonstrated with Escherichia coli strains that biosynthetic, transport, and regulatory mutations in the enterobactin system are clearly distinguishable.

   abstract = {Soils harbour high levels of microbial diversity, underpinning their ability to provide key soil functions and ecosystem services. The extreme variety of soil microbial life is often explained by reference to the physical and chemical heterogeneity of the soil environment. However, detailed understanding of this link is still lacking, particularly as micro-scale studies are difficult to scale up to the soil profile or landscape level. To address this, we used soil samples collected from a wide range of temperate oceanic habitats (e.g. arable, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland, heathland; 335 sites in total) to evaluate the link between soil texture and microbial diversity. Soil particle size distribution was measured in each sample using laser granulometry (i.e. sand, silt, clay), while the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities were determined by metabarcoding with an Illumina MiSeq using16S and ITS1 taxonomy marker gene regions, respectively. Multifractal analysis of the soil particle size distribution was then used to describe the heterogeneity of the soil particle sizes. Overall, our results showed no impact of habitat type upon textural heterogeneity indicating that it is an aspect of soil quality resistant to management decisions. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we show that soil textural heterogeneity positively influences bacterial diversity but had little impact upon fungal diversity. We also find that textural composition impacts both bacterial and fungal composition, with many specific microbial taxa showing co-occurrence relationships with clay and fine-silt sized particles. Our results strongly indicate that soil textural heterogeneity influences microbial community diversity regardless of soil management practices and biophysical activities. The close linkages between different groups of soil organisms can obscure the mechanisms driving the development of biodiversity, however, it is clear that the soil physical environment has differential impacts on organisms with different life history strategies.},

Based on a long-term field trial (1988–2001) with 15 different rotations including winter oilseed rape (OSR), winter wheat, winter barley, spring peas and spring oats, the effects of different preceding crops, pre-preceding crops and crop rotations on the grain yield of mainly OSR, winter wheat and winter barley were quantified. In the subsequent 2 years (2001/2002 and 2002/2003), winter wheat was grown on all plots in order to test the residual effects of the former crops (as preceding crops in 2002 and as pre-preceding crops in 2003) and crop rotations on growth, grain yield and yield components. Unfavourable preceding crops significantly decreased yield of OSR, wheat and barley by 10% on average, however, with a large year-to-year variation. In addition, break-crop benefits in both crops, wheat and OSR, persisted to the second year. Wheat as preceding crop mainly decreased the thousand grain weight, and to a lesser extent, the ear density of the subsequent wheat crop. The amount of wheat yield decrease negatively correlated with the simple water balance (rainfall minus evapotranspiration) in May–July. In 2001/2002 and 2002/2003, the preceding crop superimposed the crop rotation effects, thus resulting in similar effects as observed in 1988–2001. Our results clearly reveal the importance of a favourable preceding crop for the yield performance of a crop, especially wheat and OSR.},

   abstract = {Different preceding crops interact with almost all husbandry and have a major effect on crop yields. In order to quantify the yield response of winter wheat, a field trial with different preceding crop combinations (oilseed rape (OSR)-OSR-OSR-wheat-wheat-wheat), two sowing dates (mid/end of September, mid/end of October) and 16 mineral nitrogen (N) treatments (80-320 kg N ha -1) during 1993/1994-1998/1999, was carried out at Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Germany. Single plant biomass, tiller numbers m-2, biomass m-2, grain yield and yield components at harvest were investigated. During the growing season, the incidence of root rot (Gaeumannomyces graminis) was observed. Additionally, a bioassay with Lemna minor was used to identify the presence of allelochemicals in the soil after different preceding crops. Averaged over all years and all other treatments, wheat following OSR achieved nearly 9.5 t ha-1, whereas the second wheat crop following wheat yielded about 0.9 t ha-1 and the third wheat crop following 2 years of wheat about 1.9 t ha-1 less compared with wheat after OSR. A delay of the sowing date only marginally decreased grain yield by 0.2 t ha-1. Nitrogen fertilization increased grain yield after all preceding crop combinations, but at different levels. Wheat grown after OSR reached its maximum yield of 9.7 t ha-1 with 210 kg N ha-1. The third wheat crop required a N amount of 270 kg N ha -1 to achieve its yield maximum of 8.0 t ha-1. Yield losses were mainly caused by a lower ear density and a reduced thousand grain weight. About 4 weeks after plant establishment, single wheat plants following OSR accumulated more biomass compared to plants grown after wheat. Plants from the third wheat crop were smallest. This range of the preceding crop combinations was similar at all sampling dates throughout the growing season. Root rot occurred only at a low level and was excluded to cause the yield losses. The Lemna bioassay suggested the presence of allelochemicals, which might have been one reason for the poor single plant development in autumn. An increased N fertilization compensated for the lower number of ears m -2 and partly reduced the yield losses due to the unfavorable preceding crop combination. However, it was not possible to completely compensate for the detrimental influences of an unfavorable preceding crop on the grain yield of the subsequent wheat crop. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 177 taxa (2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 31 protists) were consistently detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% of the reads in our data set. Based on these results, we identify a list of key taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.},

However, it is unclear to what extent cereal yields change with crop rotation diversity and external nitrogen fertilization level over time, and which functional groups of crops provide the most yield benefit. Here, using grain yield data of small grain cereals and maize from 32 long-term (10–63 years) experiments across Europe and North America, we show that crop rotational diversity, measured as crop species diversity and functional richness, enhanced grain yields. This yield benefit increased over time. Only the yields of winter-sown small grain cereals showed a decline at the highest level of species diversity. Diversification was beneficial to all cereals with a low external nitrogen input, particularly maize, enabling a lower dependence on nitrogen fertilisers and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollution. The results suggest that increasing crop functional richness rather than species diversity can be a strategy for supporting grain yields across many environments.},

Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery.

The numbers of culturable bacteria and their antagonistic potential, as well as bacterial community fingerprints were analysed from tubers of seven field-grown potato genotypes, including two lines with tuber-accumulated zeaxanthin. The plant genotype significantly affected the number of culturable bacteria only at one field site. Zeaxanthin had no effect on the bacterial plate counts. In dual culture, 72 of 700 bacterial isolates inhibited at least one of the potato pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Verticillium dahliae or Phytophthora infestans, 12 of them suppressing all three. Most of these antagonists were identified as Bacillus or Streptomyces. From tubers of two plant genotypes, including one zeaxanthin line, higher numbers of antagonists were isolated. Most antagonists showed glucanase, cellulase and protease activity, which could represent mechanisms for pathogen suppression. PCR-DGGE fingerprints of the 16S rRNA genes of bacterial communities from the tuber surfaces revealed that the potato genotype significantly affected the Pseudomonas community structure at one site. However, the genotypes showed nearly identical fingerprints for Bacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacillus and Streptomycetaceae.

Two classical types of suppressiveness are known. General suppression owes its activity to the total microbial biomass in soil and is not transferable between soils. Specific suppression owes its activity to the effects of individual or select groups of microorganisms and is transferable. The microbial basis of specific suppression to four diseases, Fusarium wilts, potato scab, apple replant disease, and take-all, is discussed. One of the best-described examples occurs in take-all decline soils. In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. Producers of this metabolite may have a broader role in disease-suppressive soils worldwide. By coupling molecular technologies with traditional approaches used in plant pathology and microbiology, it is possible to dissect the microbial composition and complex interactions in suppressive soils.},

Mixtures containing two strains in different proportions but at a constant total population size were inoculated onto potato leaves. The population sizes of each strain and the total population size were determined when the community had reached equilibrium. A near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair exhibited an interaction similar to that expected for strains competing equally for limiting environmental resources. Replacement series with nonisogenic Ice' and Ice-P. syringae strain pairs suggested that these strains competed for limiting resources according to their relative competitive abilities. There was no evidence of any niche differentiation between the Ice' P. syringae strains and the Ice-P. syringae strain. The growth responses of epiphytes following addition of nutrients to the phyllosphere indicated that the epiphytic P. syringae populations were nutrient limited and that, under growth chamber conditions, the populations were more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen. Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice' and the Ice-P. syringae strains. Niche overlap indices calculated for the Ice' P. syringae strains with respect to Ice-P. syringae TLP2dell were uniformly high, indicating ecological similarity, and were consistent with the observed low level of coexistence. The biological frost control agent P. fluorescens A506 replaced P. syringae. This was correlated with a high degree of niche overlap between these species. In addition to yeasts and filamentous fungi, leaf surfaces support a diverse epiphytic bacterial flora, including both saprophytic and phytopathogenic species. Ice nucleation-active (Ice') Pseudomonas syringae strains are frequent components of the epiphytic microflora on plants that act as incitants of frost injury during freezing temperatures (16, 21, 31). Naturally occurring non-ice-nucleating (Ice-) strains of P. syringae and Erwinia herbicola applied preemptively to plants reduced col-onization by Ice' P. syringae strains and reduced the severity of frost injury (32, 44, 45). The majority of these antagonistic strains exhibited no in vitro antibiosis against Ice' P. syringae, and antibiosis-deficient mutants of antibiotic-producing strains were no less effective at inhibiting Ice' P. syringae strains (33, 37). These results suggested that competition for limiting environmental resources, not antibiosis, was the primary mechanism of antagonism between naturally occurring Ice-bacteria and Ice' P. syringae strains (37). It was hypothesized that genotypically and, hence, ecologically similar strains would exhibit more effective competitive exclusion than dissimilar strains (34). Near-isogenic Ice-mutants of Ice' P. syringae strains were selected following mutagenesis with ethyl meth-anesulfonate (33). In preemptive exclusion studies, near-iso-genic Ice-mutants significantly reduced the populations of parental Ice' P. syringae strains (33, 36). Such inhibition of},

   abstract = {The levels of coexistence between Pseudomonas syringae and various nonpathogenic epiphytic species in the phyllosphere of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were assessed by using replacement series. The epiphytic species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophi-lum were all capable of exhibiting higher levels of coexistence with P. syringae than was observed with a near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair. The ecological similarity of the epiphytes was estimated with niche overlap indices derived from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles. The level of coexistence of the epiphytes was inversely correlated with the ecological similarity of the strains. Hence, the level of coexistence between the epiphytes was proportional to the degree of niche differentiation, defined as the ability to utilize carbon sources not utilized by a competing strain. Comparisons of utilization profiles for groups of carbon sources (amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates) indicated the types of carbon sources for which the strains likely competed in the bean phyllosphere. P. fluorescens and P. syringae strains probably competed for most carbon sources. S. maltophilia and M. organophilum strains probably competed with P. syringae for most organic acids but few amino acids or carbohydrates. P. agglomerans strains probably competed with P. syringae for most amino acids and organic acids but few carbohydrates. A variable level of coexistence observed between P. agglomerans and P. syringae probably reflected the variability in abundance in the bean phyllosphere of the carbohydrates that P. agglomerans utilized exclusively. Leaf surfaces of plants in terrestrial ecosystems are colonized by epiphytic communities of bacteria, yeasts, and fila-mentous fungi. Many factors have been suggested to be involved in determining the species composition of such communities , including availability of immigrant inoculum (30, 31, 35), host plant species (48), host plant phenology or leaf age (7), leaf position (3), and physical environmental conditions (48). The dynamics of individual populations within the epi-phytic community are determined by rates of immigration, emigration, growth, and death (27, 30). A community, however , is more than an assemblage of independent populations and may be defined by the presence of interactions between its individual components. Evidence for such interactions in the epiphytic microbial community is plentiful and originates primarily from the literature on the biological control of phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi, and it includes antibiosis (24), hyperparasitism (33), and nutrient competition (2, 40). The phyllosphere is generally considered to be a nutrient-limited environment (2). Nutrients, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids, are leached or exuded from the leaf interior into the phyllosphere. The quantities of nutrients leached or exuded from the leaf, however, are affected by leaf age, leaf physiological status, and the presence of tissue damage (13, 21, 25, 44, 51-53). Suggestions that the epiphytic community is nutrient limited come from studies in which exogenous applications of nutrients to the phyllosphere have resulted in increases in epiphytic population sizes (5, 17, 23). Populations of the epiphytic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae were shown to be more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen (56). Competition for limiting nutritional resources has been reported between bacteria and germinating fungal spores (9, 10, 18, 42), between yeasts (8, 22), and between yeasts and phytopathogenic fungi (17, 23). The de Wit replacement series (26) has been used extensively in plant ecology to study the nature of competitive interactions between plant species. In this substitutive design, two species are planted in mixtures of various proportions but at a constant total density and the yield of each species is determined at harvest (26). Such studies have provided important insights into niche differentiation and differential resource utilization among plant species. In microbial ecology the replacement series has been used to study the competitive interactions between phytopathogenic fungi (1) and between epiphytic bacteria (56). We previously used the replacement series to demonstrate competition for limiting nutritional resources between epiphytic P. syringae strains in the potato phyllosphere (56). The epiphytic P. syringae strains were all isolated from healthy potato leaves at one geographic location, were ecologically similar (as estimated from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles), and competed for limited carbon in the phyllosphere. These strains therefore exhibited low levels of coexistence in replacement series experiments. In a study of P. syringae strains isolated from diverse hosts and geographic areas, however, levels of coexistence were strain pair specific, possibly indicating ecological niche differentiation (32). On potato leaves, the epiphyte Pseudomonas fluorescens A506 exhibited a high level of coexistence with P. syringae in replacement series experiments (56). This was suggested to result from nutritional resource partitioning, or the ability of P. fluorescens A506 to utilize abundant carbon sources in the potato phyllosphere that were not utilized by P. syringae (56). Epiphytic bacterial communities in the phyllosphere consist of diverse genera (4, 15, 19, 54) exhibiting diverse nutrient utilization patterns (19, 45, 46). Morris and Rouse (46) deter},

   abstract = {The main goal of the study was to determine the biodiversity of bacteria and their metabolic profile in the rhizosphere of four winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties (Hondia, Nordkap, Rotax, Tytanika) cultivated in Haplic Podzol soil in a no-tillage system. Two techniques, i.e., next generation sequencing (NGS, meta-barcoding of 16S rRNA community) and community level physiological profiling (CLPP), were applied to obtain a holistic picture of biodiversity. The basic soil chemical parameters (acidity, redox potential, carbon content, forms of nitrogen, and phosphorus) were also determined. It was found that the rhizospheric microbiome (at the genus level) of cv. Hondia and Rotax were significantly different from that present in the other cultivars studied. The CLPP technique demonstrated that microbial metabolic activity depended on both the type of substrate and wheat cultivars. Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids were the most easily utilized compounds in all rhizospheric soils. The principal component analysis (PCA) evidenced that the rhizospheric soils of Rotax and Nordkap were characterized by a higher functional activity (strong correlation with the Shannon-Wiener index, the Richness index, and utilization of hydrocarbons) than those of Hondia and Tytanika.},

   abstract = {Soil texture is an essential component of soil survey for estimating potentials and limitations of land use and management. It has been appreciated as an important predictor for numerous soil processes. However, its connections with the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community remain less understood. This work employed a marker gene high-throughput sequencing approach to determine soil texture-based patterns of bacterial and fungal distribution. Thirty-six intact soil cores were sampled from bermudagrass ecosystems across seven soil texture classes with sand fraction varying from 30.3 to 83.4% and clay fraction from 4.4 to 53.0%. These soil cores were arranged into three sets of equal numbers, and each set of 12 was subjected to three moisture regimes (dry spell, field moisture, and saturation-field capacity), respectively, for 15 days. Soil cores were further stratified into top and bottom sections, leading to a total of 72 samples with varying soil physical and chemical properties. Our data revealed that fungal alpha diversity was more strongly related to soil texture than bacterial alpha diversity, with fungal species richness and Shannon diversity being positively correlated with the sand fraction. Soil texture was the second most important factor after soil pH in shaping the soil microbial community. Relative abundances of some fungi (Basidiomycota and Eurotiomycetes) and filamentous bacteria (Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi) significantly increased with silt and/or clay content. The genetic potential for the degradation of organic compounds also appeared to be higher in finer textured soils than the coarse-textured soils. By identifying sand, silt or clay-preferred microbial taxa and characterizing mineral particle-dependent genetic potential of organic carbon degradation and nitrogen cycling, this work highlighted the significance of soil texture and texture-associated pores, and resource locality, in regulating microbial diversity and community composition.},

   abstract = {Soil microbial communities directly affect soil functionality through their roles in the cycling of soil nutrients and carbon storage. Microbial communities vary substantially in space and time, between soil types and under different land management. The mechanisms that control the spatial distributions of soil microbes are largely unknown as we have not been able to adequately upscale a detailed analysis of the microbiome in a few grams of soil to that of a catchment, region or continent. Here we reveal that soil microbes along a 1000 km transect have unique spatial structures that are governed mainly by soil properties. The soil microbial community assessed using Phospholipid Fatty Acids showed a strong gradient along the latitude gradient across New South Wales, Australia. We found that soil properties contributed the most to the microbial distribution, while other environmental factors (e.g., temperature, elevation) showed lesser impact. Agricultural activities reduced the variation of the microbial communities, however, its influence was local and much less than the overall influence of soil properties. The ability to predict the soil and environmental factors that control microbial distribution will allow us to predict how future soil and environmental change will affect the spatial distribution of microbes.},

   abstract = {Aims: Different drivers are known to shape rhizosphere microbiome assembly. How soil texture (Texture) and presence or lack of root hairs (Root Hair) of plants affect the rhizosphere microbiome assembly and soil potential extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) at defined rooting depth (Depth) is still a knowledge gap. We investigated effects of these drivers on microbial assembly in rhizosphere and on potential EEA in root-affected soil of maize. Methods: Samples were taken from three depths of root hair defective mutant rth3 and wild-type WT maize planted on loam and sand in soil columns after 22 days. Rhizosphere bacterial, archaeal, fungal and cercozoan communities were analysed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, ITS and 18S rRNA gene fragments. Soil potential EEA of ß-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and chitinase were estimated using fluorogenic substrates. Results: The bacterial, archaeal and cercozoan alpha- and beta-diversities were significantly and strongly altered by Texture, followed by Depth and Root Hair. Texture and Depth had a small impact on fungal assembly, and only fungal beta-diversity was significantly affected. Significant impacts by Depth and Root Hair on beta-diversity and relative abundances at taxonomic levels of bacteria, archaea, fungi and cercozoa were dependent on Texture. Likewise, the patterns of potential EEA followed the trends of microbial communities, and the potential EEA correlated with the relative abundances of several taxa. Conclusions: Texture was the strongest driver of rhizosphere microbiome and of soil potential EEA, followed by Depth and Root Hair, similarly to findings in maize root architecture and plant gene expression studies.},

This work was conducted to design primer and probe sets for the detection of methanogens using a real-time PCR with the TaqMan system. Six group-specific methanogenic primer and probe sets were designed. These sets separately detect four orders (Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales) along with two families (Methanosarcinales and Methanosaetaceae) of the order Methanosarcinales. We also designed the universal primer and probe sets that specifically detect the 16S rDNA of prokaryotes and of the domain Bacteria and Archaea, and which are fully compatible with the TaqMan real-time PCR system. Target-group specificity of each primer and probe set was empirically verified by testing DNA isolated from 28 archaeal cultures and by analyzing potential false results. In general, each primer and probe set was very specific to the target group. The primer and probe sets designed in this study can be used to detect and quantify the order-level (family-level in the case of Methanosarcinales) methanogenic groups in anaerobic biological processes and various environments. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Studying microbial diversity and the effects of external factors on the microbiome could expand our understanding of environmental alterations. Silt and sand are mineral particles that form soil texture and even though most of the soils on earth contain a fraction of them and some other soils form almost by them, their effects on the microbiome remained to elucidate. In this study, the bacterial biodiversity of sand and silt clay soils was investigated. Furthermore, their effects on plant growth have been determined. Our data showed that biodiversity and biomass of microbiome are higher in silt-based soil. It is interesting that the pseudomonas genera only exist in silt-based soil while it is in the absence of sand-based soil. In contrast, B. thuringiensis could be found in sand-based soil while it is not found in silt texture. Our data also demonstrated that there are no significant changes in stress response between the two groups however, differential physiological changes in plants inoculated with silt and sand based bacterial isolates have been observed. This data could indicate that smaller size particles could contain more bacteria with higher biodiversity due to providing more surfaces for bacteria to grow.},
