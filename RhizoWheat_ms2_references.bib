Based on the colonization ability determined by selective plating, eight strains were selected for growth chamber experiments to determine their efficacy in controlling bottom rot caused by R. solani on lettuce. Although in the first experiment all antagonists colonized the rhizosphere of lettuce with CFU counts above 2 × 106 g-1 of root fresh weight, only four isolates significantly reduced disease severity. In subsequent experiments involving these four antagonists, only Pseudomonas jessenii RU47 showed effective and consistent disease suppression. Plate counts and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of Pseudomonas-specific gacA genes amplified from total community DNA confirmed that RU47 established as the dominant Pseudomonas population in the rhizosphere of inoculated lettuce plants. Furthermore, the DGGE fingerprint revealed that R. solani AG1-IB inoculation severely affected the bacterial and fungal community structure in the rhizosphere of lettuce and that these effects were much less pronounced in the presence of RU47. Although the exact mechanism of antagonistic activity and the ecology of RU47 remain to be further explored, our results suggest that RU47 is a promising agent to control bottom rot of lettuce. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

   abstract = {A cultivation-based approach was used to determine the in vitro antagonistic potential of soil bacteria towards Rhizoctonia solani AG3 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Foln3). Four composite soil samples were collected from four agricultural sites with previous documentation of disease suppression, located in France (FR), the Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE) and the United Kingdom (UK). Similarly, two sites from Germany (Berlin, G-BR; and Braunschweig, G-BS) without documentation of disease suppression were sampled. Total bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions from the composite soil samples onto R2A, AGS and King's B media. A total of 1,788 isolates (approximately 100 isolates per medium and site) was screened for antifungal activity, and in vitro antagonists (327 isolates) were found amongst the dominant culturable bacteria isolated from all six soils. The overall proportion of antagonists and the number of isolates with inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum were highest in three of the suppressive soils (FR, NL and SE). Characterization of antagonistic bacteria revealed a high phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Siderophore and protease activity were the most prominent phenotypic traits amongst the antagonists. The composition and diversity of antagonists in each soil was site-specific. Nevertheless, none of the antimicrobial traits of bacteria potentially contributing to soil suppressiveness analyzed in this study could be regarded as specific to a given site. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with variations in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota.The microbiota populating the rhizosphere, the interface between roots and soil, can modulate plant growth, development, and health. These microbial communities are not stochastically assembled from the surrounding soil, but their composition and putative function are controlled, at least partially, by the host plant. Here, we use the staple cereal barley as a model to gain novel insights into the impact of differential applications of nitrogen, a rate-limiting step for global crop production, on the host genetic control of the rhizosphere microbiota. Using a high-throughput amplicon sequencing survey, we determined that nitrogen availability for plant uptake is a factor promoting the selective enrichment of individual taxa in the rhizosphere of wild and domesticated barley genotypes. Shotgun sequencing and metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that this taxonomic diversification is mirrored by a functional specialization, manifested by the differential enrichment of multiple Gene Ontology terms, of the microbiota of plants exposed to nitrogen conditions limiting barley growth. Finally, a plant soil feedback experiment revealed that host control of the barley microbiota underpins the assembly of a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria putatively required to sustain plant performance under nitrogen-limiting supplies. Taken together, our observations indicate that under nitrogen conditions limiting plant growth, host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions fine-tune the host genetic selection of the barley microbiota at both taxonomic and functional levels. The disruption of these recruitment cues negatively impacts plant growth. IMPORTANCE The microbiota inhabiting the rhizosphere, the thin layer of soil surrounding plant roots, can promote the growth, development, and health of their host plants. Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with variations in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota. This is particularly evident when looking at the microbiota associated with input-demanding modern cultivated varieties and their wild relatives, which have evolved under marginal conditions. However, the functional significance of these differences remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the rhizosphere microbiota of wild and cultivated genotypes of the global crop barley and determined that nutrient conditions limiting plant growth amplify the host control on microbes at the root-soil interface. This is reflected in a plant- and genotype-dependent functional specialization of the rhizosphere microbiota, which appears to be required for optimal plant growth. These findings provide novel insights into the significance of the rhizosphere microbiota for plant growth and sustainable agriculture. },

The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of growing wheat as first and second wheat after oilseed rape, as well as monoculture in a long-term field experiment over three years on (i) aboveground biomass formation, root development and nutrient acquisition during the growing season, (ii) take-all occurrence, and (iii) grain yield and yield components. Subsoil root length density of winter wheat was significantly higher after oilseed rape as pre-crop than after wheat, which was independent of take-all occurrence. Differences in wheat aboveground biomass occurred at early growth stages and were persistent until harvest. Grain yield loss correlated well with take-all disease severity in a wet year but yield differences among crop rotational positions occurred also in a dry year without visible fungal infection. Thus, an effect of the crop rotational position of wheat beyond take-all disease pressure can be assumed. Overall, wheat root length density might be the key to understand wheat biomass formation and grain yield in different crop rotational positions.},

Different soil structural properties under winter wheat as well as total aboveground biomass of wheat grown in different crop rotational positions (monoculture, first, second and third wheat after oilseed rape) were investigated in two long-term field experiments with contrasting soil texture. At both field sites, no significant effect of the crop rotational position in any of the analyzed soil structural parameters was found. Wheat biomass in spring was on average 54% higher for wheat grown after oilseed rape compared to second and third wheat after oilseed rape or monoculture.

To address this, we investigated how plant breeding history (four wheat genotypes; two with recognized drought resistance and two without) and soil water stress history (same wheat field soil from Saskatchewan with contrasting long-term irrigation) independently or interactively influenced the response of the rhizosphere, root and leaf bacterial and fungal microbiota to short-term decreases in soil water content (SWC). We used amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria and ITS region for fungi) to characterize the wheat microbiome. Fungal and bacterial communities responses to short-term decreases in SWC were mainly constrained by soil water stress history, with some smaller, but significant influence of plant genotype. One exception was the leaf-associated fungal communities, for which the largest constraint was genotype, resulting in a clear differentiation of the communities based on the genotype's sensitivity to water stress. Our results clearly indicate that soil legacy does not only affect the response to water stress of the microbes inhabiting the soil, but also of the microorganisms more closely associated with the plant tissues, and even of the plant itself.},

'M26' apple rootstocks grew into a top layer of Control soil, followed by a barrier-free split-soil layer (Control soil/ARD soil). We observed a severely reduced root growth, concomitant with enhanced gene expression of phytoalexin biosynthetic genes and phytoalexin content in roots from ARD soil, indicating a pronounced local plant defense response. Amplicon sequencing (bacteria, archaea, fungi) revealed local shifts in diversity and composition of microorganisms in the rhizoplane of roots from ARD soil. An enrichment of operational taxonomic units affiliated to potential ARD fungal pathogens (Ilyonectria and Nectria sp.) and bacteria frequently associated with ARD (Streptomyces, Variovorax) was noted. In conclusion, our integrated study supports the idea of ARD being local and not spreading into surrounding soil, as only the roots in ARD soil were affected in terms of growth, phytoalexin biosynthetic gene expression, phytoalexin production and altered microbiome structure. This study further reinforces the microbiological nature of ARD, being likely triggered by a disturbed soil microbiome enriched with low mobility of the ARD-causing agents that induce a strong plant defense and rhizoplane microbiome dysbiosis, concurring with root damage.},

We review the role of rotations in the development and preservation of soil structure. After first introducing the types of rotations in current practice and their impact on yield, we assess how soil and crop management in rotations determines soil structure, and in turn how soil structure influences crop growth and yield. We also briefly consider how soil structure might contribute to other beneficial effects of rotations, namely nutrient cycling and disease suppression. Emphasis is given to the influence of crop choice and, where relevant, interaction with tillage system and avoidance of compaction in the improvement and maintenance of soil structure. Crop rotations profoundly modify the soil environment. The sequence of crops in rotation not only influences the removal of nutrients from a soil, but also the return of crop residues, the development and distribution of biopores and the dynamics of microbial communities. These processes contribute to the development of soil structure. We have identified areas where further research is needed to enable the potential benefits of rotations in the management of soil structure to be fully exploited. These include: improved quantitative linkages between soil structure and crop growth, the consequences to soil structure and nutrient cycling of crop residue incorporation, developing natural disease suppression, amelioration of subsoils by crop roots, the fate of carbon deposited by plant roots in soil and the fate of organic nitrogen in soil.},

Although fungicides have the potential to protect seed/seedlings from critical early stage diseases such as damping-off and root/stem rots, results from previous studies are not consistent in terms of seed-applied fungicide's ability to mitigate yield losses. In the current study, the relationship between estimated soybean production losses due to seedling diseases and estimated seed-applied fungicide use was investigated using annual data from 28 soybean growing states in the U.S. over the period of 2006 to 2014. National, regional (northern and southern U.S.), state, and temporal scale trends were explored using mixed effects version of the regression analysis. Mixed modeling allowed computing generalized R2 values for conditional (R2GLMM(c); contains fixed and random effects) and marginal (R2GLMM(m); contains only fixed effects) models. Similar analyses were conducted to investigate how soybean production was related to fungicide use. National and regional scale modeling revealed that R2GLMM(c) values were significantly larger compared to R2GLMM(m) values, meaning fungicide use had limited utility in explaining the national/regional scale variation of yield loss and production. The state scale analysis revealed the usefulness of seedapplied fungicides to mitigate seedling diseases-associated soybean yield losses in Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, and Ohio. Further, fungicide use positively influenced the soybean production and yield in Illinois and South Dakota. Taken together, use of seed-applied fungicide did not appear to be beneficial to many of the states. Our findings corroborate the observations made by a number of scientists through field scale seed-applied fungicide trials across the U.S and reiterate the importance of need base-use of seed-applied fungicides rather than being a routine practice in soybean production systems.},

The establishment of microbial inoculants in the rhizosphere is a prerequisite for successful plant-microorganism interactions. This study investigated whether a consortium of beneficial microorganisms establishes in the rhizosphere of a winter crop during the vegetation period, including the winter growing season. In addition, we aimed for a better understanding of its effect on plant performance under different farming practices. Winter rye plants grown in a long-time field trial under conventional or organic farming practices were inoculated after plant emergence in autumn with a microbial consortium containing Pseudomonas sp.

The density of the microbial inoculants in the rhizosphere and root-associated soil was quantified in autumn and the following spring. Furthermore, the influence of the consortium on plant performance and on the rhizosphere bacterial community assembly was investigated using a multidisciplinary approach. Selective plating showed a high colonization density of individual microorganisms of the consortium in the rhizosphere and root-associated soil of winter rye throughout its early growth cycle. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that the farming practice affected mainly the rhizosphere bacterial communities in autumn and spring. However, the microbial consortium inoculated altered also the bacterial community composition at each sampling time point, especially at the beginning of the new growing season in spring. Inoculation of winter rye with the microbial consortium significantly improved the plant nutrient status and performance especially under organic farming. In summary, the microbial consortium showed sufficient efficacy throughout vegetation dormancy when inoculated in autumn and contributed to better plant performance, indicating the potential of microbe-based solutions in organic farming where nutrient availability is limited.},

   abstract = {Background: One promise of the recently presented microbiome definition suggested that, in combination with unifying concepts and standards, microbiome research could be important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in various microbiota. With this commentary we want to further elaborate this suggestion, because we noticed specific signatures in microbiota affected by the Anthropocene. Results: Here, we discuss this based on a review of available literature and our own research targeting exemplarily the plant microbiome. It is not only crucial for plants themselves but also linked to planetary health. We suggest that different human activities are commonly linked to a shift of diversity and evenness of the plant microbiota, which is also characterized by a decrease of host specificity, and an increase of r-strategic microbes, pathogens, and hypermutators. The resistome, anchored in the microbiome, follows this shift by an increase of specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms as well as an increase of plasmid-associated resistance genes. This typical microbiome signature of the Anthropocene is often associated with dysbiosis and loss of resilience, and leads to frequent pathogen outbreaks. Although several of these observations are already confirmed by meta-studies, this issue requires more attention in upcoming microbiome studies. Conclusions: Our commentary aims to inspire holistic studies for the development of solutions to restore and save microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning as well as the closely connected planetary health.

Methods and Results: Sixty randomly chosen antagonistic bacterial strains originally isolated from rhizosphere of three different host plants of V. dahliae - strawberry, potato and oilseed rape - were evaluated for biocontrol and plant growth promotion by analysing in vitro antagonism towards V. dahliae and other plant pathogenic fungi, production of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes and plant growth-promoting effects on strawberry seedlings. To test the plant growth-promoting effect, a microplate assay with strawberry seedlings was developed. Although the rhizobacterial strains were isolated from different plants they showed effects on the growth of strawberry seedlings. According to the in vitro biocontrol and plant growth-promoting activity, the three best candidates Pseudomonas putida B E2 (strawberry rhizosphere), Ps. chlororaphis K15 (potato rhizosphere) and Serratia plymuthica R12 (oilseed rape rhizosphere) were selected for greenhouse experiments to verify the in vitro screening results. Under greenhouse conditions the isolates selected according to this strategy were as effective, or more effective than commercial biocontrol agents and may therefore possibly be valuable as antagonists of V. dahliae. Conclusions: In this study, the screening strategy resulted in a selection of three interesting biocontrol candidates against Verticillium: Ps. putida B E2 (strawberry rhizosphere), Ps. chlororaphis K15 (potato rhizosphere) and Ser. plymuthica R12 (oilseed rape rhizosphere).

A sigmoidal relationship was identified between inoculum concentration and the proportion of fields exceeding the two disease thresholds. A logistic response curve was used to further examine this relationship and evaluate the boundaries between take-all risk categories. G. graminis var. tritici boundaries between medium- and high-risk categories were clustered near or within the upper plateau of the relationship. Alternative G. graminis var. tritici boundaries for a three-category system were identified that provided better separation of take-all risk between categories. This information could improve prediction of the risk of severe take-all. © 2012 The American Phytopathological Society.},

   abstract = {The RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) annotation engine was built in 2008 to annotate bacterial and archaeal genomes. It works by offering a standard software pipeline for identifying genomic features (i.e., protein-encoding genes and RNA) and annotating their functions. Recently, in order to make RAST a more useful research tool and to keep pace with advancements in bioinformatics, it has become desirable to build a version of RAST that is both customizable and extensible. In this paper, we describe the RAST tool kit (RASTtk), a modular version of RAST that enables researchers to build custom annotation pipelines. RASTtk offers a choice of software for identifying and annotating genomic features as well as the ability to add custom features to an annotation job. RASTtk also accommodates the batch submission of genomes and the ability to customize annotation protocols for batch submissions. This is the first major software restructuring of RAST since its inception.},

In particular, the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software tools allows data acquisition and analysis on an unprecedented scale. Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known "mock communities" at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of meta-analysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

The most influ- ential might be the organisms comprising the soil microbial community of the rhizosphere, which is the soil surrounding the roots of plants where complex interactions occur be- tween the roots, soil, and microorganisms. Root exudates act as substrates and signaling molecules for microbes creating a complex and interwoven relationship between plants and the microbiome. While individual microorganisms such as endophytes, symbionts, pathogens, and plant growth pro- moting rhizobacteria are increasingly featured in the litera- ture, the larger community of soil microorganisms, or soil microbiome, may have more far-reaching effects. Each mi- croorganism functions in coordination with the overall soil microbiome to influence plant health and crop productivity. Increasing evidence indicates that plants can shape the soil microbiome through the secretion of root exudates. The molecular communication fluctuates according to the plant development stage, proximity to neighboring species, man- agement techniques, and many other factors.

   abstract = {Background: Plant roots assemble microbial communities both inside the roots and in the rhizosphere, and these root-associated microbiomes play pivotal roles in plant nutrition and productivity. Although it is known that increased synthetic fertilizer input in Chinese farmlands over the past 50 years has resulted in not only increased yields but also environmental problems, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how crops under elevated nutrient input shape root-associated microbial communities, especially through adjusting the quantities and compositions of root metabolites and exudates. Methods: The compositions of bacterial and fungal communities from the roots and rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four levels of long-term inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization were characterized at the tillering, jointing and ripening stages. The root-released organic carbon (ROC), organic acids in the root exudates and soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil active carbon (SAC) in the rhizosphere were quantified. Results: ROC levels varied dramatically across wheat growth stages and correlated more with the bacterial community than with the fungal community. Rhizosphere SOC and SAC levels were elevated by long-term N fertilization but varied only slightly across growth stages. Variation in the microbial community structure across plant growth stages showed a decreasing trend with N fertilization level in the rhizosphere. In addition, more bacterial and fungal genera were significantly correlated in the jointing and ripening stages than in the tillering stage in the root samples. A number of bacterial genera that shifted in response to N fertilization, including Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Devosia, correlated significantly with acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid levels. Conclusions: Our results indicate that both plant growth status and N input drive changes in the microbial community structure in the root zone of wheat. Plant growth stage demostrated a stronger influence on bacterial than on fungal community composition. A number of bacterial genera that have been described as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) responded positively to N fertilization, and their abundance correlated significantly with the organic acid level, suggesting that the secretion of organic acids may be a strategy developed by plants to recruit beneficial microbes in the root zone to cope with high N input. These results provide novel insight into the associations among increased N input, altered carbon availability, and shifts in microbial communities in the plant roots and rhizosphere of intensive agricultural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Three Enterobacter agglomerans strains which produce and excrete proteins with chitinolytic activity were found while screening soil-borne bacteria antagonistic to fungal plant pathogens. The chitinolytic activity was induced when the strains were grown in the presence of colloidal chitin as the sole carbon source. It was quantitated by using assays with chromogenic p-nitrophenyl analogs of disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide derivatives of N-acetylglucosamine. A set of three fluorescent substrates with a 4-methylum-belliferyl group linked by-1,4 linkage to N-acetylglucosamine mono-or oligosaccharides were used to identify the chitinolytic activities of proteins which had been renatured following their separation by electrophoresis. This study provides the most complete evidence for the presence of a complex of chitinolytic enzymes in Enterobacter strains. Four enzymes were detected: two N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidases of 89 and 67 kDa, an endochitinase with an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa, and a chitobiosidase of 50 kDa. The biocontrol ability of the chitinolytic strains was demonstrated under greenhouse conditions. The bacteria decreased the incidence of disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani in cotton by 64 to 86%. Two Tn5 mutants of one of the isolates, which were deficient in chitinolytic activity, were unable to protect plants against the disease. Various strains of Enterobacter spp. have been described as being effective biological control agents antagonistic to many fungal phytopathogens. Several isolates of Enterobacter cloacae are known to be biocontrol agents for different rots and preemergence damping-off of pea, beet, cotton, and cucumber plants incited by Pythium spp., as well as of Fusarium wilt of cucumber and some other plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens (7, 22, 35). Enterobacter aerogenes B8 significantly reduced infections of apple crown and root rot caused by Phytophtora cactorum (38). Some strains of Enterobacter agglo-merans were shown to be efficient in the control of plant diseases caused by different bacterial and fungal pathogens (10, 22, 27). Various traits expressed synchronously or in a controlled sequence are considered responsible for the action of these strains as biological control agents (24). The ability to produce an antibiotic-like substance was found in strain E. aerogenes B8 (39). Strains of E. cloacae and E. agglomerans were found to produce hydroxamate siderophores (2, 16) and different volatile and nonvolatile antifungal metabolites (11, 37). Competition for nutrients and rhizosphere colonization ability were considered possible mechanisms of antifungal activity in E. cloacae (40) and E. agglomerans (10), respectively. Although some strains of Enterobacter spp. suppress many fungal plant pathogens, data pertaining to the chitinolytic activity of these bacteria are still restricted to only one strain of E. cloacae, and these data are rather inconsistent (17, 29). It is well known, however, that chitin, an insoluble linear polymer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a-1,4 linkage, is a major structural component of most fungal cell walls, and that many species of bacteria, streptomycetes, actinomycetes, fungi, and plants produce chitinolytic enzymes (21, 32). Bacteria from the genera Aeromonas (12) and Serratia (26) and fungi from the genera Gliocladium (4) and Trichoderma (5), all of which produce chitinolytic enzymes, have been shown to be potential agents for the biological control of plant diseases caused by various phytopathogenic fungi. Evidence that these enzymes are responsible for that effect has been presented (18, 33). Attachment to fungal hyphae was considered an important mechanism in the biocontrol activity of E. cloacae strains against Pythium ultimum (23), and the stimulation of this binding by chitinolytic enzymes from Trichoderma harzianum was demonstrated (17). In the present work, we found that three soil-borne strains of E. agglomerans, which are antagonists of many phytopatho-genic fungi, possess strong chitinolytic activity. The strains were isolated in the course of a screening program for rhizo-spheric bacteria exhibiting a broad range of antagonism toward microbial phytopathogens (3). These strains were found to produce and excrete a complex of chitinolytic enzymes, which were resolved and partially characterized. The role of the chiti-nolytic enzymes in suppressing fungal phytopathogens was studied by using Rhizoctonia solani in cotton as a model, comparing natural isolates with mutants deficient in chitinolytic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cultures and growth media. The three strains of bacteria used in this work (IC960, IC993, and IC1270) were independently isolated from the rhizosphere of different grape bushes in vineyards in the Samarkand region (Republic of Uzbekistan). The isolates were identified as Enterobacter (Pantoea) agglomerans by microbiological and biochemical tests and by gas chromatographic analysis of the whole-cell fatty acid methyl esters. The identification was performed independently in the Bacterial Division of the All-Russia Collection of Microorganisms (Puschino, Moscow Region, Russia) and in the Department of Plant Pathology , Auburn University. The strains were found to produce as yet unidentified antibiotic-like substances and to exhibit proteolytic activity (our unpublished observation).

   abstract = {Background and aims: Take-all, caused by the soilborne pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, (Ggt), is an important root disease of wheat. Continuous wheat cropping has been shown to induce take-all decline (TAD). This research investigated the mechanisms of TAD in 13 New Zealand soils in two experiments and identified the associated microorganisms using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Methods: In Experiment 1, a sterile sand/maize-meal mixture inoculated or not inoculated with Ggt, was added at 4 % (w/w) to sterilised and non-sterilised soils to determine their ability to suppress take-all, and to help identify the nature of suppression. Experiment 2 investigated the transferability of suppressive properties in five of the soils from Experiment 1. The microbial communities of these five soils were analysed using PCR-DGGE. Results: Ten of the soils were able to suppress take-all but the suppression was biological in nature in only four of these soils. The suppressive properties of two of the soils were transferred to a γ-irradiated base soil amended with Ggt, indicating that suppression could be specific in nature (i.e., attributed to a specific microorganism or group of microorganisms). The suppressive properties in one soil were not transferrable, suggesting a general form of suppression, most probably because the conditions in the soil were suitable for other microorganisms to compete with Ggt. DGGE analyses of the microbial communities for five of the soils showed similar banding patterns for those with similar forms of suppression (specific, general and non-suppressive) and identified the potential microorganisms that distinguished them. Conclusion: These distinguishing microorganisms are likely to independently or interactively have a function in suppressing take-all.},

   abstract = {Take-all, caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is arguably the most-studied root disease of any crop, yet remains the most important root disease of wheat worldwide. S. D. Garrett launched the study of root diseases and soilborne pathogens as an independent field of science starting in the middle of the 20th century, inspired by and based in large part on his research on take-all during the first half of the 20th century. Because there has been neither a source of host plant resistance nor an effective and economical fungicide for use against this disease, the focus for nearly a century has been on cultural and biological controls. In spite of the intensive and extensive works towards these controls, with mostly site-or soil-specific success, the only broadly and consistently effective controls require either crop rotation (break crops), or the converse, wheat monoculture to induce take-all decline. Take-all decline has become the model system for research on biological control of plant pathogens in the rhizosphere and provided the first proof to the scientific world after decades of debate that antibiotics are both produced in soils and play a role in the ecology of soil microorganisms. On the other hand, even the best yields following take-all decline are rarely equal to those achieved with crop rotation. Because of this, the continuing trends globally to shorten rather than lengthen the rotations in wheat-based cropping systems, and the growing use of direct-seed (no-till) trashy systems to reduce costs and protect soil and water resources, new methods to control take-all are needed more than ever. With high resolution maps of the genomes of cereals and other grasses now available, including a complete sequence of the rice genome, and the interesting differences as well as striking similarities among the genomes of cereals and related grasses, gene transfer to wheat from oats, rice, maize and other grass species resistant to G. graminis var. tritici should be pursued. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Grapevine decline affects viticulture worldwide. It is caused by a wide range of individual and combined biotic and abiotic factors. Some declines remain unexplained because they are not associated with known pathological symptoms or mineral dysregulation. Vineyard microbiological quality is an important area of study, since grapevine-associated microbiome primarily originates in vineyard soils and determines host health and development. To understand the decrease of growth and yield, and the high mortality of plants in vineyards affected by these declines, a multisite study investigated soil microbial communities. Spatial (terroir: two distinct geographical locations) and temporal (season: autumn and spring) dimensions were added to the inter-row soil status factor (S for areas with symptomatic vines and AS for those with asymptomatic vines). The microbiomes of AS and S soils were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, the fungal ITS1 region (Internal Transcribed Spacer), or the fungal 18S rRNA gene for Glomeromycota family. Geographical location was the strongest driver of bacterial and fungal microbial communities, while the seasonal factor primarily influenced bacterial community. Based on metabarcoding analysis, symptomatic soils presented enriched bacterial taxa that can be potentially beneficial for grapevine growth. In addition, fungal diversity and richness, including Glomeromycota division, were greater in symptomatic soils. Fungal genera associated with grapevine diseases were detected across all conditions, with higher abundances in symptomatic soils. These findings reveal that vineyard soils affected by unexplained decline are a potential source of both fungal pathogens and beneficial microorganisms.},

   abstract = {Plants recruit beneficial microbial communities in the rhizosphere that are involved in a myriad of ecological services, such as improved soil quality, nutrient uptake, abiotic stress tolerance, and soil-borne disease suppression. Disease suppression caused by rhizosphere microbiomes has been important in managing soil-borne diseases in wheat. The low heritability of resistance in wheat to soil-borne diseases like Rhizoctonia root rot has made management of these diseases challenging, particularly in direct-seeded systems. Identification of wheat genotypes that recruit rhizosphere microbiomes that promote improved plant fitness and suppression of the pathogen could be an alternative approach to disease management through genetic improvement. Several growth chamber cycling experiments were conducted using six winter wheat genotypes (PI561725, PI561727, Eltan, Lewjain, Hill81, Madsen) to determine wheat genotypes that recruit suppressive microbiomes. At the end of the third cycle, suppression assays were done by inoculating R. solani into soils previously cultivated with specific wheat genotypes to test suppression of the pathogen by the microbiome. Microbiome composition was characterized by sequencing of 16S rDNA (V1-V3 region). Among the growth cycling lengths, 160-day growth cycles exhibited the most distinct rhizosphere microbiomes among the wheat genotypes. Suppression assays showed that rhizosphere microbiomes of different wheat genotypes resulted in significant differences in shoot length (value of p=0.018) and had an impact on the pathogenicity of R. solani, as observed in the reduced root disease scores (value of p=0.051). Furthermore, soils previously cultivated with the ALMT1 isogenic lines PI561725 and PI561727 exhibited better seedling vigor and reduced root disease. Microbiome analysis showed that Burkholderiales taxa, specifically Janthinobacterium, are differentially abundant in PI561727 and PI561725 cultivated soils and are associated with reduced root disease and better growth. This study demonstrates that specific wheat genotypes recruit different microbiomes in growth chamber conditions but the microbial community alterations were quite different from those previously observed in field plots, even though the same soils were used. Genotype selection or development appears to be a viable approach to controlling soil-borne diseases in a sustainable manner, and controlled environment assays can be used to see genetic differences but further work is needed to explain differences seen between growth chamber and field conditions.},

However, during various plant developmental processes, shifts in the diversity and function of bacterial communities often occur. This study investigated the diversity of bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere, roots, and aboveground plant organs of wheat and canola at stem elongation, flowering, and ripening stages. The growth-chamber experiment consisted of wheat and canola grown in Orthic Brown Chernozem Calcic Kastanozem and Orthic Black Calcic Chernozem soils from agricultural fields in Saskatchewan, Canada. Rhizosphere bacterial communities of wheat and canola were mainly influenced by soil characteristics, whereas a specific root endophytic community was associated with each crop species. These results suggest that each crop may select distinct root bacterial endophytes from the rhizosphere. Bacteria associated with aboveground plant organs exhibited high variability among crop species and soils. The most abundant bacterial genera associated with the rhizosphere of the crops included Gemmatimonas, Solirubrobacter, and Nocardioides, as well as unclassified genera of families Commamonadaceae, Chitinophagaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. Other genera (e.g., Stenotrophomonas, Streptomyces, and Variovorax) were predominant in wheat roots, whereas species of Lentzea and Pantoea were the most abundant root endophytes detected in canola. Bacterial communities associated with aboveground organs consisted mostly of species of Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas, and unclassified members of the family Enterobacteriacaeae. This study also revealed that plant growth stages can modulate the diversity of rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria.

   abstract = {Introduction: Inoculation of plants with beneficial microorganisms may improve plant performance yet suffers from efficacy variability. A solution might be the combined application of different inoculants as consortium. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of single or combined inoculation of Trichoderma harzianum, strain TGFG411, and a consortium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on plant growth, and native microbial communities (here bacteria/archaea, fungi and AMF) in root-associated soil (RAS) and rhizosphere (RH), that is, soil loosely or tightly attached to the roots, respectively. Materials and Methods: A greenhouse experiment was carried out with non-sterile agricultural soil and the model crop maize, which was single inoculated with either TGFG411 or AMF or received a combined inoculation of TGFG411 + AMF. Control plants received only water. Seven weeks after the second AMF inoculation, the plant growth promotion capacity of the inoculants was measured based on shoot and root parameters. Furthermore, RAS and RH microbiota (fungi including AMF, bacteria and archaea) were assessed via a combination of different cultivation-dependent, microscopic and DNA-based methods. Results: After 7 weeks of maize growth, both single and combined inoculation of AMF and TGFG411 enhanced shoot dry weight and led to a significant reduction in root biomass. The TGFG411 strain successfully established in the soil. However, no definite evidence for the establishment of the inoculated AMF was found. Single or combined inoculation of TGFG411 and AMF modified the composition of total bacterial in the RH, whereas modulated total fungal communities in the RAS. Conclusion: The combined inoculation did not result in a significant improvement of plant performance compared with single inoculation likely due to optimal nutrient supply. However, samples receiving the combined inoculation exhibited a distinct modulation of the native RAS/RH microbiota, which may influence the inoculant efficacy under less favourable conditions.},

   abstract = {Background: Although coevolutionary signatures of host-microbe interactions are considered to engineer the healthy microbiome of humans, little is known about the changes in root-microbiome during plant evolution. To understand how the composition of the wheat and its ancestral species microbiome have changed over the evolutionary processes, we performed a 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis on rhizobacterial communities associated with a phylogenetic framework of four Triticum species T. urartu, T. turgidum, T. durum, and T. aestivum along with their ancestral species Aegilops speltoides, and Ae. tauschii during vegetative and reproductive stages. Results: In this study, we illustrated that the genome contents of wild species Aegilops speltoides and Ae. tauschii can be significant factors determining the composition of root-associated bacterial communities in domesticated bread wheat. Although it was found that domestication and modern breeding practices might have had a significant impact on microbiome-plant interactions especially at the reproductive stage, we observed an extensive and selective control by wheat genotypes on associated rhizobacterial communities at the same time. Our data also showed a strong genotypic variation within species of T. aestivum and Ae. tauschii, suggesting potential breeding targets for plants surveyed. Conclusions: This study performed with different genotypes of Triticum and Aegilops species is the first study showing that the genome contents of Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii along with domestication-related changes can be significant factors determining the composition of root-associated bacterial communities in bread wheat. It is also indirect evidence that shows a very extensive range of host traits and genes are probably involved in host-microbe interactions. Therefore, understanding the wheat root-associated microbiome needs to take into consideration of its polygenetic mosaic nature.},

   abstract = { The plethora of microorganisms inhabiting the immediate vicinity of healthy root systems plays a pivotal role in facilitating optimal nutrient and water acquisition by plants. In this study, we investigated the soil microbial communities associated with wheat roots within distinct microhabitats, root-affected soil (RA), rhizosphere (RH), and rhizoplane (RP). These microhabitats were explored at five soil depths, and our investigation focused on wheat cultivated in a monoculture (WM) and wheat crop rotation (WR). Overall, there were significant differences in microbiota composition between WM and WR, although no difference in bacterial diversity was observed. Differentially abundant taxa between WM and WR were observed in all three microhabitats, emphasizing important insights on the localization of commonly associated bacteria to wheat roots. Comparing the microhabitats, RP exhibited the most dissimilar microbial composition between WM and WR. Taxa that were differentially abundant between WM and WR were observed in the three microhabitats. The high relative abundance of taxa belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria in the rhizoplane, such as Devosia , Pseudomonas , Shinella , and Sphingomonas , along with other genera, such as Pedobacter ( Bacteroidota ), Agromyces and Streptomyces ( Actinobacteriota ) highlight the recruitment of potentially beneficial bacterial taxa to the vicinity of the roots. Interestingly, these taxa were observed along the entire length of wheat roots, even at depths of up to 120 cm. The presence of specific taxa associated with wheat roots at all soil depths may be beneficial for coping with nutrient and water shortages, particularly under upcoming climate scenarios, where water may be a limiting factor for plant growth. This study provides valuable insights for designing management strategies to promote a diverse and healthy microbial community in wheat cropping systems, considering soil depth and microhabitats as key factors. Although, at this time, we cannot link specific bacterial taxa to yield reductions commonly observed in monocultural fields, we propose that some genera may enhance plant nutrient or water acquisition in rotation compared with monoculture. Advanced technologies, including functional analyses and culturomics, may further enhance our understanding of the ecological roles played by these microbes and their potential applications in sustainable agriculture. },

The specificity of the forward primer in combination with different reverse ones was tested with genomic DNA from a variety of bacterial strains. Most actinomycetes investigated could be separated by TGGE and DGGE, with both techniques giving similar results. Two strategies were employed to study natural microbial communities. First, we used the selective amplification of actinomycete sequences (E. coli positions 226 to 528) for direct analysis of the products in denaturing gradients. Second, a nested PCR providing actinomycete-specific fragments (E. coli positions 226 to 1401) was used which served as template for a PCR when conserved primers were used. The products (E. coli positions 968 to 1401) of this indirect approach were then separated by use of gradient gels. Both approaches allowed detection of actinomycete communities in soil. The second strategy allowed the estimation of the relative abundance of actinomycetes within the bacterial community. Mixtures of PCR-derived 16S rDNA fragments were used as model communities consisting of five actinomycetes and five other bacterial species. Actinomycete products were obtained over a 100-fold dilution range of the actinomycete DNA in the model community by specific PCR; detection of the diluted actinomycete DNA was not possible when conserved primers were used. The methods tested for detection were applied to monitor actinomycete community changes in potato rhizosphere and to investigate actinomycete diversity in different soils.},

These include (i) to solve context dependency for microbial inoculation approaches and (ii) to identify the genetic determinants to allow breeding for beneficial plant-microbiome interactions.

An outdoor experiment was set up using sandy loam soil. WW was grown in rhizotrons, in soil after oilseed rape (KW1), after one season of WW (KW2), and after three successive seasons of WW (KW4). We applied zymography and harvested the plants at the stem elongation stage to observe changes in the activity of β-glucosidase (BGU) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), as well as using glucose (GLU) imaging to observe glucose release patterns in the rhizosphere of WW. Several biochemical and microbial properties of the bulk soil and the rhizosphere of the rotational positions were measured. KW2 and KW4 exhibited reduced plant biomass compared to KW1. There was a higher root length density and root mean diameter as well as a lower specific root length for KW1 compared to KW2 and KW4. KW1 soil had a lower mineral N concentration and microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) than KW2 and KW4, which translated to a lower plant C:N ratio. A greater rhizosphere extent of BGU and LAP across the soil profile was also visible for KW1 compared to KW2 and KW4 using zymography. Lower dissolved organic C and hotspot areas of GLU in the rhizosphere of successive WW might explain shifts in the microbial community composition, possibly leading to a dysbiosis with the soil microbes in the rhizosphere. Soil depth and rotational position explained most of the variance in the soil microbial communities. The relative abundance of Acidobacteriota, Gemmatimonadota, Nitrospirota, and Chloroflexi significantly varied among the rotational positions. Our results highlight the effect of WW rotational positions on soil and plant properties, as well as microbial community dynamics, and provide evidence for the pathways driving biomass decline in successively grown WW.},

Plant-microbe interactions can be beneficial, neutral or harmful to the host plant. Over the last decade, with the development of next generation DNA sequencing technology, our understanding of the plant microbiome structure has dramatically increased. Considering that defining the wheat microbiome is key to leverage crop production in a sustainable way, here we describe how different factors drive microbiome assembly in wheat, including crop management, edaphic-environmental conditions and host selection. In addition, we highlight the benefits to take a multidisciplinary approach to define and explore the wheat core microbiome to generate solutions based on microbial (synthetic) communities or single inoculants.

Between host crops, G. graminis var. tritici survives saprophytically on crop debris and by infecting susceptible grass weeds or cereal volunteers. Invasion of roots in the following wheat crop results in reduced grain yield and quality. Take-all is commonly assessed in the field by visual inspection. Molecular-based methods are also available to detect G. graminis var. tritici, including a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay that indirectly measures the amount of pathogen DNA in environmental samples. The qPCR is used as part of a commercial tool (known as PreDicta B™) to predict the risks of take-all in wheat crops prior to planting, which are dependent on the amount of Gaeumannomyces inoculum in field soils. Unfortunately, the costs associated with the PreDicta B™ test can be prohibitive to its use. As a result, in this study, an alternative qPCR assay was developed to measure directly the DNA of G. graminis var. tritici.

   abstract = {The impacts of broadleaf crop, pasture or fallow breaks within cereal-based cropping systems are widely acknowledged, but most studies have focussed on the first cereal crop after the break. We report a series of four field experiments in a semi-arid cropping zone of Southern Australia in which the impacts of a range of Year 1 sequence options (crops, pasture and fallow) on Year 3 and 4 wheat crops were investigated. In three of the experiments, two phases of the same experiment were commenced in successive years, providing seven sequence phases. In three of the seven phases (at three of the four sites), the Year 1 treatments influenced the yield of Year 3 or Year 4 wheat crops by 0.6, 0.9 and 0.9tha-1, although different responses between phases of the same experiments at two sites provided clear evidence of significant seasonal interactions. Interactions of Year 1 sequence treatments with tillage, crop species/varieties and/or added P-fertiliser treatments in intervening years also occurred at some sites. The largest persistent yield impacts related to the preservation of differences in residual nitrogen (N), and in some cases water following Year 1 crops through subsequent dry seasons, which were frequent in most experimental phases. Higher residual N levels after legumes and canola could persist for 2-3 years and induce yield penalties due to "haying-off" when Year 3 or 4 wheat crops experienced dry spring conditions. Such effects were offset following Year 1 fallow due to increased residual water at depth. Increases in the cereal root diseases take-all (Gaeumannomyces tritici) and rhizoctonia (Rhizoctonia solani AG8) due to Year 1 wheat also persisted through dry seasons and reduced Year 3 wheat yield in some experiments. We found no evidence for a significant role for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in yield of Year 3 and 4 wheat crops. We demonstrate that large and significant yield impacts (>0.5tha-1), both positive and negative, can persist for 3-4 years in semi-arid environments as a result of water, N and disease inoculum legacies of Year 1 crop sequence choices. Prolonged dry periods help to preserve these legacies, so that persistent and unpredictable crop sequence effects will be a feature of cropping systems in semi-arid areas with variable climates. © 2014 .},

   abstract = {In Europe, the framework for sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production was subject to considerable changes and for the future it is expected that sugar beet cultivation might concentrate around the sugar factories for economic reasons. Based on data from a national sugar beet farmers’ survey and multi-year crop rotation trials, the effects of cropping interval (number of years in between two subsequent sugar beet crops) and of preceding crops on sugar yield were elucidated under current Central European management conditions. The dominating sugar beet cropping interval was ≥4 years in the farm survey with pronounced differences between regions. However, the cropping intervals 2, 3, and ≥4 years did not affect the sugar yield. Therefore, significant differences in sugar yield between regions were assumed to be caused by multiple interactions between year, site, and farmers’ skills. Throughout Germany, the dominating preceding crops in sugar beet cultivation were winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). In the field trials, the sugar yield was 5% higher after pea (Pisum sativum L.) compared to maize (Zea mays L.) as preceding crop, while differences between the preceding crops pea and winter wheat, and wheat and maize were not significant. Repeated measurements of canopy development and leaf color during the growing season revealed a higher N-availability after pea as preceding crop. However, decreased growth after maize was not completely compensated for by high N-fertilizer doses. Overall, the causes for the differences in sugar yield between the preceding crops remained open. The results do not support concerns about substantial yield losses in sugar beet production due to a reduction in the cropping interval from 3 to 2 years. Nevertheless, short rotations with maize and sugar beet might increase the risk of Rhizoctonia solani crown and root rot infestation. Leguminous crops such as pea offer the potential for higher sugar beet yield with lower N-fertilizer doses.},

IAA production was detected in 86 isolates (23.0%), ACC deaminase activity in 168 isolates (44.9%), and siderophore(s) synthesis in 213 isolates (57.0%). Among the rhizobacteria showing PGPT, 162 isolates had multiple traits showing more than two types of PGPT. The PGPT-possesing rhizobacteria were more abundant in the RP (82%) samples than the RS (75%). There was a negative correlation (-0.656, p<0.05) between the IAA producers and the ACC deaminase producers. Clustering analysis by principal component analysis showed that RP was the most important factor influencing the ecological distribution and physiological characterization of PGPT-possesing rhizobacteria.},

Herein, winter wheat was selected as a test plant to explore the assembly process of total bacteria from bulk soil (BS) and rhizosphere soil (RS), and phoD-harbouring bacteria in RS at a long-term (14 years) trial site. We also identified core microbes that are potentially relevant to soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling genes and soil biogeochemical properties, and investigated the relationships between soil variables, functional genes and wheat productivity. The results showed that the microhabitat of the plant, rather than P fertilizer input, was the main factor affecting the microbial diversity, composition and co-occurrence networks. The BS bacterial community was driven by deterministic processes but the RS and phoD bacterial communities were dominated by stochastic processes. The influence of deterministic processes decreased with increasing soil nutrient content. A core microbial community consisted of 10 OTUs in different microhabitats and was significantly related to soil functional genes and properties. In the rhizosphere soil, significant correlations were found between soil variables, soil functional bacteria and genes, and crop productivity. Synthesis and applications. This study provides empirical evidence that the assembly process of the microbial community is governed by environmental factors in various soil environments and provides new perspectives on the sustainable improvement of crop productivity.

This study aimed to elucidate whether ARD is systemic, i.e. whether the contact of parts of the root system with ARD soil causes the whole plant to show poor shoot and root growth. A split-root experiment was conducted with seedlings of 'M26', offering the same plant for its root system the choice between the substrates ARD soil (+ARD), γ-sterilized ARD soil (-ARD) or soil from a grass parcel (Control) with the following combinations: +ARD/+ARD,-ARD/-ARD; +ARD/-ARD; +ARD/Control. Root growth was analysed throughout the 34-day growing period. Samples from bulk, rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil were collected separately for each compartment, and analysed by fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene or ITS fragments amplified from total community (TC) DNA. The response of the plant to +ARD was not systemic as root growth in-ARD compartment was always superior to root growth in +ARD soil. Crosswise 15N-labelling of the N-fertilizer applied to the split-root compartments showed that nitrate-N uptake efficiency was higher for roots in-ARD soil compared to those in +ARD. Bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of the same plants differed significantly between the compartments containing +ARD/-ARD or +ARD/Control. The strongest differences between the bacterial fingerprints were observed in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere. Bacterial genera with increased abundance in response to ARD were mainly Streptomyces but also Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Rhizobium, Lysobacter and Variovorax. The strongest differences between the fungal fingerprints were observed in bulk soil. Our data showed that the response of the apple plant to ARD soil is local and not systemic.},

In cultivar rotation field experiments on the Rothamsted Farm (Hertfordshire, UK) we demonstrated a substantial reduction in take-all disease and grain yield increases of up to 2.4 tonnes/ha when a low take-all inoculum building wheat cultivar was grown in the first year of wheat cropping. Phenotyping of 71 modern elite wheat cultivars for the take-all inoculum build-up trait across six diverse trial sites identified a few cultivars which exhibited a consistent lowering of take-all inoculum build-up. However, there was also evidence of a significant interaction effect between trial site and cultivar when a pooled Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedure was conducted. There was no evidence of an unusual rooting phenotype associated with take-all inoculum build-up in two independent field experiments and a sand column experiment. Together our results highlight the complex interactions between wheat genotype, environmental conditions and take-all inoculum build-up. Further work is required to determine the underlying genetic and mechanistic basis of this important phenomenon.},

The causal agent is the ascomycete soil-borne pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt). Current control measures are ineffective, because Ggt can remain saprophytic in soils for long periods. Therefore, the study of the microbiome residing in suppressive soils (SS) is a promising niche of Ggt biocontrol. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of Serratia sp., Bacillus sp., and Acinetobacter sp. isolated from SS against the incidence of Ggt on wheat. Our results demonstrated that plants inoculated with the bacterial consortium in both greenhouse and field conditions were highly efficient in Ggt biocontrol, more so than individual strains. The disease reduction was evidenced by higher biomass production, fewer copies of the Ggt genome with a concomitant curtailment of blackening of roots, a decrease of lipid peroxidation, and an increase of superoxide dismutase activity. The ability of the microbial consortium over that of single strains could be attributable to interspecies communication as a strategy to biocontrol; i.e., higher chitinase activity. In conclusion, bacterial consortia from SS are an important niche of Ggt biocontrol, serving as a model for other soil-borne pathogens.},

Various microbial taxa including beneficial bacteria and fungi are currently used as biofertilizers, as they successfully colonize the rhizosphere, rhizoplane or root interior. Despite their great potential to improve soil fertility, biofertilizers have yet to replace conventional chemical fertilizers in commercial agriculture. In the last 10 years, multi-omics studies have made a significant step forward in understanding the drivers, roles, processes, and mechanisms in the plant microbiome. However, translating this knowledge on microbiome functions in order to capitalize on plant nutrition in agroecosystems still remains a challenge. Here, we address the key factors limiting successful field applications of biofertilizers and suggest potential solutions based on emerging strategies for product development. Finally, we discuss the importance of biosafety guidelines and propose new avenues of research for biofertilizer development.},

The results indicated that the criterion for isolation of phosphate solubilizers based on the formation of visible halo/zone on agar plates is not a reliable technique, as many isolates which did not show any clear zone on agar plates solubilized insoluble inorganic phosphates in liquid medium.

The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1–3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn–soybean–wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. In addition, disease suppressive potential was significantly diminished in the (non-crop) fallow treatment compared to the most diverse crop rotation treatments. The composition of the microbial community could be more important than diversity to disease suppressive function in our study. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.},

   abstract = {Bacterial wilt (BW) disease causes huge economic loss. Heretofore there is no effective way to completely control BW. Here, cover crops (pea, rapeseed, and wheat) were used to restore declining soil properties and control BW. Cover crops can increase content of soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen and enzymatic activities, as well as suppress BW. Different kinds of cover crops are distinguished in recovering different soil properties. For instance, rapeseed can inhibit BW more effectively than wheat and pea, while wheat has the best effect on increasing soil organic matter, urease, and invertase. Nevertheless, pea improves catalase better than rapeseed and wheat. Moreover, relative abundance of plant-beneficial bacteria in cover crop treatments is higher than that in the control, with a negative correlation with disease index. For example, wheat has the best effect on improving the growth of plant-beneficial bacteria, followed by rapeseed. The bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling are enriched in pea treatments. However, the relative abundance of pathogen and denitrifying bacteria in cover crop treatments is lower than that in the control, with a positive correlation with disease index. The count of bacteria genes involved in nutrients cycling, antibiotics synthesis, and biodegradation of toxic compounds in cover crop treatments is higher than that in the control. Wheat includes more these genes than rapeseed and pea. Overall, cover crops can restore declining soil properties and suppress BW by increasing soil nutrients and beneficial bacteria as well as decreasing pathogen. Among all cover crops, wheat is considered as the optimal one.},

PCR analysis and Southern hybridization demonstrated that specific genes within the biosynthetic loci for Phl and PCA are conserved among various Pseudomonas strains of worldwide origin. The frequency of Phl-and PCA-producing fluorescent pseudomonads was determined on roots of wheat grown in three soils suppressive to take-all disease of wheat and four soils conducive to take-all by colony hybridization followed by PCR. Phenazine-producing strains were not detected on roots from any of the soils. However, Phl-producing fluorescent pseudomonads were isolated from all three take-all-suppressive soils at densities ranging from approximately 5 10 5 to 2 10 6 CFU per g of root. In the complementary conducive soils, Phl-producing pseudomonads were not detected or were detected at densities at least 40-fold lower than those in the suppressive soils. We speculate that fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce Phl play an important role in the natural suppressiveness of these soils to take-all disease of wheat.},

Methods: Endophytes were isolated from wheat grown under six fertiliser conditions in the long term Broadbalk Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK. Samples were taken in May and July from root and leaf tissues. Results: Root and leaf communities differed in abundance and composition of endophytes. Endophytes were most abundant in roots and the Proteobacteria were most prevalent. In contrast, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, the Gram positive phyla, were most prevalent in the leaves. Both fertiliser treatment and sample time influenced abundance and relative proportions of each phylum and genus in the endosphere. A higher density of endophytes was found in the Nil input treatment plants. Conclusions: Robust isolation techniques and stringent controls are critical for accurate recovery of endophytes. The plant tissue type, plant growth stage, and soil fertiliser treatment all contribute to the composition of the endophytic bacterial community in wheat. These results should help facilitate targeted development of endophytes for beneficial applications in agriculture.},

The multi-stress tolerance-inducing endophyte Enterobacter sp.

Although SA187 flagellin epitopes are recognized by the FLS2 receptor, SA187-triggered salt tolerance functions independently of the FLS2 system. In contrast, overexpression of the chitin receptor components LYK4 and LYK5 compromised the beneficial effect of SA187 on Arabidopsis, while it was enhanced in lyk4 mutant plants. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the role of LYK4 is intertwined with a function in remodelling defence responses with growth and root developmental processes. LYK4 interferes with modification of plant ethylene homeostasis by Enterobacter SA187 to boost salt stress resistance. Collectively, these results contribute to unlock the crosstalk between components of the plant immune system and beneficial microbes and point to a new role for the Lys-motif receptor LYK4 in beneficial plant–microbe interaction.},

   abstract = {Soils suppressive to soilborne pathogens have been identified worldwide for almost 60 years and attributed mainly to suppressive or antagonistic microorganisms. Rather than identifying, testing and applying potential biocontrol agents in an inundative fashion, research into suppressive soils has attempted to understand how indigenous microbiomes can reduce disease, even in the presence of the pathogen, susceptible host, and favorable environment. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing of microbiomes have provided new tools to reexamine and further characterize the nature of these soils. Two general types of suppression have been described: specific and general suppression, and theories have been developed around these two models. In this review, we will present three examples of currently-studied model systems with features representative of specific and general suppressiveness: suppression to take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), Rhizoctonia bare patch of wheat (Rhizoctonia solani AG-8), and Streptomyces. To compare and contrast the two models of general versus specific suppression, we propose a number of hypotheses about the nature and ecology of microbial populations and communities of suppressive soils. We outline the potential and limitations of new molecular techniques that can provide novel ways of testing these hypotheses. Finally, we consider how this greater understanding of the phytobiome can facilitate sustainable disease management in agriculture by harnessing the potential of indigenous soil microbes.},

   abstract = {In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based cropping systems, rotation crops often provide a yield benefit to the following wheat crop. This has been documented for legume crops and canola (Brassica napus L.). In the present study, we examined bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of wheat and canola at six paired locations on fall and spring sampling dates using high-throughput sequencing of marker genes (bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacers). Soil type was the primary driver of both fungal and bacterial communities, with the communities of locations geographically closest, and with the same soil type, clustering together. Season (fall vs spring sampling) had the next strongest effect, followed by the crop species. Differences between the wheat and canola were more evident in the spring than in the fall. However, in contrast, bacterial and fungal species richness and diversity were not related to location or season, and instead were consistently higher in the rhizosphere of canola compared to wheat. Many bacterial groups were shared across both crop species, especially Janthinobacterium and Kaistobacter. Bacterial communities of wheat in the fall were dominated by Actinomycetes and Acidobacteria. But in the spring, these communities shifted to fast growing bacterial copiotrophs, including Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Oxalobacteraceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae. Saprotrophic fungi such as Ulocladium, Mortierella, Cryptoccocus, Chaetomium, Penicillium and Trichoderma were also common to, and equally abundant in, the rhizosphere of both crops. Potential wheat root pathogens such as Thanatephorus (Rhizoctonia) Ceratobasidium, Oculimacula, Typhula, and Microdochium were more abundant in the wheat rhizosphere compared to canola. In conclusion, most of the communities of fungi and bacteria are not “host specific” but colonize the roots of both wheat and canola with differing relative abundance dependent on the season. A much smaller group of taxa were unique to the specific crop. This work provides novel insight into changes in crop rhizosphere communities when canola is introduced into dryland monoculture wheat cropping systems.},

   abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities, despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on fitness differences and resource overlap between individual colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R). Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution, resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating that the leaf’s spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments and a framework to predict competition outcomes.

Two independent experiments were carried out in 2011 on an experimental plot system with three soil types sharing the same cropping history and weather conditions for more than 10 years. Rifampicin resistant mutants of the inoculants were used to evaluate their colonization in the rhizosphere of lettuce. The rhizosphere bacterial community structure was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total community DNA to get insights into the effects of the inoculants and R. solani on the indigenous rhizosphere bacterial communities. Both inoculants showed a good colonization ability of the rhizosphere of lettuce with more than 106 colony forming units per g root dry mass two weeks after planting. An effect of the soil type on rhizosphere competence was observed for 3Re4-18 but not for RU47. In both experiments a comparable rhizosphere competence was observed and in the presence of the inoculants disease symptoms were either significantly reduced, or at least a non-significant trend was shown. Disease severity was highest in diluvial sand followed by alluvial loam and loess loam suggesting that the soil types differed in their conduciveness for bottom rot disease. Compared to effect of the soil type of the rhizosphere bacterial communities, the effects of the pathogen and the inoculants were less pronounced.

The ternary complex chrome azurol S/iron(lII)/hexadecyltrimethylam-monium bromide, with an extinction coefficient of approximately 100,000 M-' cm-' at 630 nm, serves as an indicator. When a strong chelator removes the iron from the dye, its color turns from blue to orange. Because of the high sensitivity, determination of siderophores in solution and their characterization by paper electrophoresis chromatography can be performed directly on supematants of culture fluids. The method is also applicable to agar plates. Grange halos around the colonies on blue agar are indicative of siderophore excretion. It was demonstrated with Escherichia coli strains that biosynthetic, transport, and regulatory mutations in the enterobactin system are clearly distinguishable. The method was successfully used to screen mutants in the iron uptake system of two Rhizobium meliloti strains, DM5 and},

   abstract = {Soils harbour high levels of microbial diversity, underpinning their ability to provide key soil functions and ecosystem services. The extreme variety of soil microbial life is often explained by reference to the physical and chemical heterogeneity of the soil environment. However, detailed understanding of this link is still lacking, particularly as micro-scale studies are difficult to scale up to the soil profile or landscape level. To address this, we used soil samples collected from a wide range of temperate oceanic habitats (e.g. arable, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland, heathland; 335 sites in total) to evaluate the link between soil texture and microbial diversity. Soil particle size distribution was measured in each sample using laser granulometry (i.e. sand, silt, clay), while the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities were determined by metabarcoding with an Illumina MiSeq using16S and ITS1 taxonomy marker gene regions, respectively. Multifractal analysis of the soil particle size distribution was then used to describe the heterogeneity of the soil particle sizes. Overall, our results showed no impact of habitat type upon textural heterogeneity indicating that it is an aspect of soil quality resistant to management decisions. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we show that soil textural heterogeneity positively influences bacterial diversity but had little impact upon fungal diversity. We also find that textural composition impacts both bacterial and fungal composition, with many specific microbial taxa showing co-occurrence relationships with clay and fine-silt sized particles. Our results strongly indicate that soil textural heterogeneity influences microbial community diversity regardless of soil management practices and biophysical activities. The close linkages between different groups of soil organisms can obscure the mechanisms driving the development of biodiversity, however, it is clear that the soil physical environment has differential impacts on organisms with different life history strategies.},

Based on a long-term field trial (1988–2001) with 15 different rotations including winter oilseed rape (OSR), winter wheat, winter barley, spring peas and spring oats, the effects of different preceding crops, pre-preceding crops and crop rotations on the grain yield of mainly OSR, winter wheat and winter barley were quantified. In the subsequent 2 years (2001/2002 and 2002/2003), winter wheat was grown on all plots in order to test the residual effects of the former crops (as preceding crops in 2002 and as pre-preceding crops in 2003) and crop rotations on growth, grain yield and yield components. Unfavourable preceding crops significantly decreased yield of OSR, wheat and barley by 10% on average, however, with a large year-to-year variation. In addition, break-crop benefits in both crops, wheat and OSR, persisted to the second year. Wheat as preceding crop mainly decreased the thousand grain weight, and to a lesser extent, the ear density of the subsequent wheat crop. The amount of wheat yield decrease negatively correlated with the simple water balance (rainfall minus evapotranspiration) in May–July. In 2001/2002 and 2002/2003, the preceding crop superimposed the crop rotation effects, thus resulting in similar effects as observed in 1988–2001. Our results clearly reveal the importance of a favourable preceding crop for the yield performance of a crop, especially wheat and OSR.},

In order to quantify the yield response of winter wheat, a field trial with different preceding crop combinations (oilseed rape (OSR)-OSR-OSR-wheat-wheat-wheat), two sowing dates (mid/end of September, mid/end of October) and 16 mineral nitrogen (N) treatments (80-320 kg N ha -1) during 1993/1994-1998/1999, was carried out at Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Germany. Single plant biomass, tiller numbers m-2, biomass m-2, grain yield and yield components at harvest were investigated. During the growing season, the incidence of root rot (Gaeumannomyces graminis) was observed. Additionally, a bioassay with Lemna minor was used to identify the presence of allelochemicals in the soil after different preceding crops. Averaged over all years and all other treatments, wheat following OSR achieved nearly 9.5 t ha-1, whereas the second wheat crop following wheat yielded about 0.9 t ha-1 and the third wheat crop following 2 years of wheat about 1.9 t ha-1 less compared with wheat after OSR. A delay of the sowing date only marginally decreased grain yield by 0.2 t ha-1. Nitrogen fertilization increased grain yield after all preceding crop combinations, but at different levels. Wheat grown after OSR reached its maximum yield of 9.7 t ha-1 with 210 kg N ha-1. The third wheat crop required a N amount of 270 kg N ha -1 to achieve its yield maximum of 8.0 t ha-1. Yield losses were mainly caused by a lower ear density and a reduced thousand grain weight. About 4 weeks after plant establishment, single wheat plants following OSR accumulated more biomass compared to plants grown after wheat. Plants from the third wheat crop were smallest. This range of the preceding crop combinations was similar at all sampling dates throughout the growing season. Root rot occurred only at a low level and was excluded to cause the yield losses. The Lemna bioassay suggested the presence of allelochemicals, which might have been one reason for the poor single plant development in autumn. An increased N fertilization compensated for the lower number of ears m -2 and partly reduced the yield losses due to the unfavorable preceding crop combination. However, it was not possible to completely compensate for the detrimental influences of an unfavorable preceding crop on the grain yield of the subsequent wheat crop. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In 1996/97-1998/99, winter wheat was grown in a field trial with two preceding crops (oilseed rape (OSR) vs. winter wheat), two sowing dates (end of September vs. end of October), eight mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments (0-200 kg N ha-1) and fluquinconazole seed treatment (no vs. yes), which was carried out at the Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Ger-many. Tiller numbers m-2 , biomass m-2 , grain yield, and yield components at harvest of wheat (cv. Toronto) were investigated. During the growing season, the incidence of take-all caused by Ggt was rated on a scale of 1-9. Averaged over all years and all other treatments, wheat following OSR achieved 8 t ha-1 , whereas wheat following wheat yielded 1 t ha-1 (13%) less compared with wheat after OSR, due to a reduction of all yield components. A delay of the sowing date only marginally decreased grain yield by 0.2 t ha-1. N fertilization increased grain yield after all preceding crop combinations, but at different levels. Fluquinconazole seed treatment augmented yield by 0.05 t ha-1 in the first wheat and by 0.11 t ha-1 in the second wheat. Take-all occurred at a very low level in all three years (2.2-3.2). Wheat as preceding crop significantly increased Ggt severity at maturity from 2.3 (after OSR) up to 3.2, whereas fluquinconazole seed treatment reduced take-all by 0.2 units. Disease progress curves based on the sum of degree-days since sowing (base: 0°C) revealed a very low Ggt infestation at the end of autumn growth and at the beginning of spring growth, but a progressive increase developed throughout the further growing season. Based on the data of wheat following wheat and fertilized with 0 or 40 kg N ha-1 , a relationship between disease rating and grain yield was established using a linear-plateau function, which indicates yield penalties if Ggt rating exceeds 2.5 units at maturity. Since the preceding crop not only changes the inoculum of take-all but other parameters like soil structure, weed infestation, nutrient status, amount and composition of residues etc., the possibility of chemical control of Ggt allows to study the fungus without altering the plant environment. Der bodenbürtige Pilz Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), der Schwarzbeinigkeit an Weizen, Gerste und Roggen verursacht, wird als die wichtigste Krankheit von Weizen in engen Fruchtfolgen mit einem hohen Getreideanteil ange-sehen. In den Vegetationsperioden 1996/97-1998/99 wurde auf dem Versuchsgut Hohenschulen bei Kiel (Schleswig-Holstein) ein Feldversuch mit Winterweizen (cv. Toronto) durchgeführt, in dem zwei Vorfrüchte (Winterraps vs. Winter-weizen), zwei Aussaattermine (Ende September vs. Ende Oktober), acht Stickstoffstufen (0-200 kg N ha-1) und der Einsatz von Fluquinconazol als Saatgutbehandlungsmittel getestet wurden. Während der Vegetationsperiode wurden die Anzahl der Triebe je m 2 und die Trockenmassebildung untersucht. Zur Ernte wurden der Kornertrag und die Ertrags-struktur erfasst. Zu allen Untersuchungsterminen erfolgte eine Bonitur des Befalls mit Schwarzbeinigkeit auf einer Skala von 1-9. Im Mittel der Jahre und der übrigen Versuchsfaktoren rea-lisierte Weizen nach Raps 8 t ha-1 , während vom Weizen nach Weizen einen um 1 t ha-1 (13%) geringeren Ertrag geerntet wurden. Die Ertragseinbußen beruhten auf einer Reduktion aller drei Ertragskomponenten (Ährenzahl je m 2 , Kornzahl je Ähre, Tausendkornmasse). Eine verspätete Aussaat reduzierte den Ertrag lediglich um 0.2 t ha-1. Die N-Düngung erhöhte den Kornertrag nach beiden Vorfrüchten, allerdings auf unter-schiedlichem Niveau. Eine Saatgutbehandlung mit Fluquinco-nazol steigerte den Ertrag des Weizens nach Raps um 0.05 t ha-1 und den des Weizens nach Weizen um 0.11 t ha-1. In allen drei Jahren trat Schwarzbeinigkeit nur in geringem Maße (2.2-3.2 zur Ernte) auf. Im Vergleich zu Raps (2.3) steigerte die Vorfrucht Weizen den Ggt-Befall auf 3.2. Der Einsatz von Fluquinconazol senkte den Befall um 0.2 Bonitur-stufen. Der Befallsverlauf in Abhängigkeit der Temperatur-summe seit Aussaat (Basis: 0°C) zeigte einen geringen Befall vor und nach Winter, der aber im weiteren Verlauf progressiv zunahm. Die Befalls-Verlust-Relation wurde für Weizen nach Weizen in den ungedüngten bzw. mit 40 kg N ha-1 gedüngten Varianten mittels einer Linear-Plateau-Funktion geschätzt. Danach ist mit Ertragseinbußen zu rechnen, wenn der Ggt-Befall zur Ernte den Wert von 2.5 überschreitet. Da die Vorfrucht nicht nur das Erregerinokulum, sondern auch noch andere Parameter wie Bodenstruktur, Verunkrautung, Nährstoffhaus-halt, Menge und Zusammensetzung der Ernterückstände etc. beeinflusst, eröffnet die chemische Kontrolle von Ggt mittels Saatgutbehandlung die Möglichkeit, den Erreger zu unter-suchen, ohne die Umwelt der Pflanze zu verändern.},

We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 177 taxa (2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 31 protists) were consistently detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% of the reads in our data set. Based on these results, we identify a list of key taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.},

However, it is unclear to what extent cereal yields change with crop rotation diversity and external nitrogen fertilization level over time, and which functional groups of crops provide the most yield benefit. Here, using grain yield data of small grain cereals and maize from 32 long-term (10–63 years) experiments across Europe and North America, we show that crop rotational diversity, measured as crop species diversity and functional richness, enhanced grain yields. This yield benefit increased over time. Only the yields of winter-sown small grain cereals showed a decline at the highest level of species diversity. Diversification was beneficial to all cereals with a low external nitrogen input, particularly maize, enabling a lower dependence on nitrogen fertilisers and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollution. The results suggest that increasing crop functional richness rather than species diversity can be a strategy for supporting grain yields across many environments.},

These reactors included seven (six mesophilic and one thermophilic) digesting sewage sludge (SS) and 14 (ten mesophilic and four thermophilic) codigesting (CD) various combinations of wastes from slaughterhouses, restaurants, households, etc. The pyrosequencing generated more than 160 000 sequences representing 11 phyla, 23 classes, and 95 genera of Bacteria and Archaea. The bacterial community was always both more abundant and more diverse than the archaeal community. At the phylum level, the foremost populations in the SS reactors included Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Spirochetes, and Euryarchaeota, while Firmicutes was the most prevalent in the CD reactors. The main bacterial class in all reactors was Clostridia. Acetoclastic methanogens were detected in the SS, but not in the CD reactors. Their absence suggests that methane formation from acetate takes place mainly via syntrophic acetate oxidation in the CD reactors. A principal component analysis of the communities at genus level revealed three clusters: SS reactors, mesophilic CD reactors (including one thermophilic CD and one SS), and thermophilic CD reactors. Thus, the microbial composition was mainly governed by the substrate differences and the process temperature. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

We isolated lines of bread wheat by hybridizing diploid (Aegilops tauschii) with tetraploid Triticum durum and crossed it with a modern cultivar of Triticum aestivum. The newly created, synthetic hybrid wheat, which recapitulate the breeding history of wheat through artificial selection, is found to support a microbiome enriched in beneficial Glomeromycetes fungi, but also in, potentially detrimental, Nematoda. We hypothesize that during wheat domestication this plant-microbe interaction diminished, suggesting an evolutionary tradeoff; sacrificing advantageous nutrient acquisition through fungal interactions to minimize interaction with pathogenic fungi. Increased plant selection for Glomeromycetes and Nematoda is correlated with the D genome derived from A. tauschii. Despite differences in their soil microbiota communities, overall wheat plants consistently show a low ratio of eukaryotes to prokaryotes. We propose that this is a mechanism for protection against soil-borne fungal disease and appears to be deeply rooted in the wheat genome. We suggest that the influence of plants on the composition of their associated microbiota is an integral factor, hitherto overlooked, but intrinsic to selection during wheat domestication.},

However, the mechanistic understanding of plant–soil feedbacks, as well as their roles in natural ecosystems in proportion to other possible drivers, is still in its infancy. Such knowledge will enhance our capacity to determine the contribution of plant–soil feedback to community and ecosystem responses under global environmental change. Here, we review how plant–soil feedbacks may develop under extreme drought and precipitation events, CO2 and nitrogen enrichment, temperature increase, land use change and plant species loss vs. gain. We present a framework for opening the ‘black box of soil’ considering the responses of the various biotic components (enemies, symbionts and decomposers) of plant–soil feedback to the global environmental changes, and we discuss how to integrate these components to understand and predict the net effects of plant–soil feedbacks under the various scenarios of change. To gain an understanding of how plant–soil feedback plays out in realistic settings, we also use the framework to discuss its interaction with other drivers of plant community composition, including competition, facilitation, herbivory, and soil physical and chemical properties. We conclude that understanding the role that plant–soil feedback plays in shaping the responses of plant community composition and ecosystem processes to global environmental changes requires unravelling the individual contributions of enemies, symbionts and decomposers. These biotic factors may show different response rates and strengths, thereby resulting in different net magnitudes and directions of plant–soil feedbacks under various scenarios of global change. We also need tests of plant–soil feedback under more realistic conditions to determine its contribution to changes in patterns and processes in the field, both at ecologically and evolutionary relevant time-scales.},

Yet they have a limited maximum sequence length screening ability, restricting studies in screening DNA stretches of single 16S rRNA gene hypervariable (V) regions. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of properties of four consecutive V regions (V3-6) on commonly applied analytical methodologies in bacterial ecology studies. Using an in silico approach, the performance of each V region was compared with the complete 16S rRNA gene stretch. We assessed related properties of the soil derived bacterial sequence collection of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database and concomitantly performed simulations based on published datasets. Results indicate that overall the most prominent V region for soil bacterial diversity studies was V3, even though it was outperformed in some of the tests. Despite its high performance during most tests, V4 was less conserved along flanking sites, thus reducing its ability for bacterial diversity coverage. V5 performed well in the non-redundant RDP database based analysis. However V5 did not resemble the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence results as well as V3 and V4 did when the natural sequence frequency and occurrence approximation was considered in the virtual experiment. Although, the highly conserved flanking sequence regions of V6 provide the ability to amplify partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from very diverse owners, it was demonstrated that V6 was the least informative compared to the rest examined V regions. Our results indicate that environment specific database exploration and theoretical assessment of the experimental approach are strongly suggested in 16S rRNA gene based bacterial diversity studies. © 2012 Vasileiadis et al.},

   abstract = {Canonical plant stress biology research has focused mainly on the dynamic regulation of internal genetic pathways in stress responses. Increasingly more studies suggest that plant-mediated timely reshaping of the microbiota could also confer benefits in responding to certain biotic and abiotic stresses. This has led to the “cry for help” hypothesis, which is supported by the identification of plant genetic regulators integrating biotic/abiotic stress signaling and microbiota sculpting. Although diverse genetic mutants have been reported to affect microbiota composition, it has been challenging to confirm the causal link between specific microbiota changes and plant phenotypic outputs (e.g., fitness benefits) due to the complexity of microbial community composition. This limits the understanding of the relevance of plant-mediated microbiota changes. We reviewed the genetic bases of host-mediated reshaping of beneficial microbiota in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and summarized the practical approaches linking microbiota changes and “functional outputs” in plants. Further understanding of the key regulators and pathways governing the assembly of stress-alleviating microbiota would benefit the design of crops that could dynamically enlist beneficial microbiota under conditions of stress.},

   abstract = {Plant-pathogen interactions are shaped by multiple environmental factors, making it difficult to predict disease dynamics even in relatively simple agricultural monocultures. Here, we explored how variation in the initial soil microbiome predicts future disease outcomes at the level of individual plants. We found that the composition and functioning of the initial soil microbiome predetermined whether the plants survived or succumbed to disease. Surviving plant microbiomes were associated with specific rare taxa, highly pathogen-suppressing Pseudomonas and Bacillus bacteria, and high abundance of genes encoding antimicrobial compounds. Microbiome-mediated plant protection could subsequently be transferred to the next plant generation via soil transplantation. Together, our results suggest that small initial variation in soil microbiome composition and functioning can determine the outcomes of plant-pathogen interactions under natural field conditions.},

The numbers of culturable bacteria and their antagonistic potential, as well as bacterial community fingerprints were analysed from tubers of seven field-grown potato genotypes, including two lines with tuber-accumulated zeaxanthin. The plant genotype significantly affected the number of culturable bacteria only at one field site. Zeaxanthin had no effect on the bacterial plate counts. In dual culture, 72 of 700 bacterial isolates inhibited at least one of the potato pathogens Rhizoctonia solani, Verticillium dahliae or Phytophthora infestans, 12 of them suppressing all three. Most of these antagonists were identified as Bacillus or Streptomyces. From tubers of two plant genotypes, including one zeaxanthin line, higher numbers of antagonists were isolated. Most antagonists showed glucanase, cellulase and protease activity, which could represent mechanisms for pathogen suppression. PCR-DGGE fingerprints of the 16S rRNA genes of bacterial communities from the tuber surfaces revealed that the potato genotype significantly affected the Pseudomonas community structure at one site. However, the genotypes showed nearly identical fingerprints for Bacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Bacillus and Streptomycetaceae.

Two classical types of suppressiveness are known. General suppression owes its activity to the total microbial biomass in soil and is not transferable between soils. Specific suppression owes its activity to the effects of individual or select groups of microorganisms and is transferable. The microbial basis of specific suppression to four diseases, Fusarium wilts, potato scab, apple replant disease, and take-all, is discussed. One of the best-described examples occurs in take-all decline soils. In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. Producers of this metabolite may have a broader role in disease-suppressive soils worldwide. By coupling molecular technologies with traditional approaches used in plant pathology and microbiology, it is possible to dissect the microbial composition and complex interactions in suppressive soils.},

Mixtures containing two strains in different proportions but at a constant total population size were inoculated onto potato leaves. The population sizes of each strain and the total population size were determined when the community had reached equilibrium. A near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair exhibited an interaction similar to that expected for strains competing equally for limiting environmental resources. Replacement series with nonisogenic Ice' and Ice-P. syringae strain pairs suggested that these strains competed for limiting resources according to their relative competitive abilities. There was no evidence of any niche differentiation between the Ice' P. syringae strains and the Ice-P. syringae strain. The growth responses of epiphytes following addition of nutrients to the phyllosphere indicated that the epiphytic P. syringae populations were nutrient limited and that, under growth chamber conditions, the populations were more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen. Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice' and the Ice-P. syringae strains. Niche overlap indices calculated for the Ice' P. syringae strains with respect to Ice-P. syringae TLP2dell were uniformly high, indicating ecological similarity, and were consistent with the observed low level of coexistence. The biological frost control agent P. fluorescens A506 replaced P. syringae. This was correlated with a high degree of niche overlap between these species. In addition to yeasts and filamentous fungi, leaf surfaces support a diverse epiphytic bacterial flora, including both saprophytic and phytopathogenic species. Ice nucleation-active (Ice') Pseudomonas syringae strains are frequent components of the epiphytic microflora on plants that act as incitants of frost injury during freezing temperatures (16, 21, 31). Naturally occurring non-ice-nucleating (Ice-) strains of P. syringae and Erwinia herbicola applied preemptively to plants reduced col-onization by Ice' P. syringae strains and reduced the severity of frost injury (32, 44, 45). The majority of these antagonistic strains exhibited no in vitro antibiosis against Ice' P. syringae, and antibiosis-deficient mutants of antibiotic-producing strains were no less effective at inhibiting Ice' P. syringae strains (33, 37). These results suggested that competition for limiting environmental resources, not antibiosis, was the primary mechanism of antagonism between naturally occurring Ice-bacteria and Ice' P. syringae strains (37). It was hypothesized that genotypically and, hence, ecologically similar strains would exhibit more effective competitive exclusion than dissimilar strains (34). Near-isogenic Ice-mutants of Ice' P. syringae strains were selected following mutagenesis with ethyl meth-anesulfonate (33). In preemptive exclusion studies, near-iso-genic Ice-mutants significantly reduced the populations of parental Ice' P. syringae strains (33, 36). Such inhibition of},

   abstract = {The levels of coexistence between Pseudomonas syringae and various nonpathogenic epiphytic species in the phyllosphere of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were assessed by using replacement series. The epiphytic species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophi-lum were all capable of exhibiting higher levels of coexistence with P. syringae than was observed with a near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair. The ecological similarity of the epiphytes was estimated with niche overlap indices derived from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles. The level of coexistence of the epiphytes was inversely correlated with the ecological similarity of the strains. Hence, the level of coexistence between the epiphytes was proportional to the degree of niche differentiation, defined as the ability to utilize carbon sources not utilized by a competing strain. Comparisons of utilization profiles for groups of carbon sources (amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates) indicated the types of carbon sources for which the strains likely competed in the bean phyllosphere. P. fluorescens and P. syringae strains probably competed for most carbon sources. S. maltophilia and M. organophilum strains probably competed with P. syringae for most organic acids but few amino acids or carbohydrates. P. agglomerans strains probably competed with P. syringae for most amino acids and organic acids but few carbohydrates. A variable level of coexistence observed between P. agglomerans and P. syringae probably reflected the variability in abundance in the bean phyllosphere of the carbohydrates that P. agglomerans utilized exclusively. Leaf surfaces of plants in terrestrial ecosystems are colonized by epiphytic communities of bacteria, yeasts, and fila-mentous fungi. Many factors have been suggested to be involved in determining the species composition of such communities , including availability of immigrant inoculum (30, 31, 35), host plant species (48), host plant phenology or leaf age (7), leaf position (3), and physical environmental conditions (48). The dynamics of individual populations within the epi-phytic community are determined by rates of immigration, emigration, growth, and death (27, 30). A community, however , is more than an assemblage of independent populations and may be defined by the presence of interactions between its individual components. Evidence for such interactions in the epiphytic microbial community is plentiful and originates primarily from the literature on the biological control of phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi, and it includes antibiosis (24), hyperparasitism (33), and nutrient competition (2, 40). The phyllosphere is generally considered to be a nutrient-limited environment (2). Nutrients, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids, are leached or exuded from the leaf interior into the phyllosphere. The quantities of nutrients leached or exuded from the leaf, however, are affected by leaf age, leaf physiological status, and the presence of tissue damage (13, 21, 25, 44, 51-53). Suggestions that the epiphytic community is nutrient limited come from studies in which exogenous applications of nutrients to the phyllosphere have resulted in increases in epiphytic population sizes (5, 17, 23). Populations of the epiphytic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae were shown to be more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen (56). Competition for limiting nutritional resources has been reported between bacteria and germinating fungal spores (9, 10, 18, 42), between yeasts (8, 22), and between yeasts and phytopathogenic fungi (17, 23). The de Wit replacement series (26) has been used extensively in plant ecology to study the nature of competitive interactions between plant species. In this substitutive design, two species are planted in mixtures of various proportions but at a constant total density and the yield of each species is determined at harvest (26). Such studies have provided important insights into niche differentiation and differential resource utilization among plant species. In microbial ecology the replacement series has been used to study the competitive interactions between phytopathogenic fungi (1) and between epiphytic bacteria (56). We previously used the replacement series to demonstrate competition for limiting nutritional resources between epiphytic P. syringae strains in the potato phyllosphere (56). The epiphytic P. syringae strains were all isolated from healthy potato leaves at one geographic location, were ecologically similar (as estimated from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles), and competed for limited carbon in the phyllosphere. These strains therefore exhibited low levels of coexistence in replacement series experiments. In a study of P. syringae strains isolated from diverse hosts and geographic areas, however, levels of coexistence were strain pair specific, possibly indicating ecological niche differentiation (32). On potato leaves, the epiphyte Pseudomonas fluorescens A506 exhibited a high level of coexistence with P. syringae in replacement series experiments (56). This was suggested to result from nutritional resource partitioning, or the ability of P. fluorescens A506 to utilize abundant carbon sources in the potato phyllosphere that were not utilized by P. syringae (56). Epiphytic bacterial communities in the phyllosphere consist of diverse genera (4, 15, 19, 54) exhibiting diverse nutrient utilization patterns (19, 45, 46). Morris and Rouse (46) deter},

Two techniques, i.e., next generation sequencing (NGS, meta-barcoding of 16S rRNA community) and community level physiological profiling (CLPP), were applied to obtain a holistic picture of biodiversity. The basic soil chemical parameters (acidity, redox potential, carbon content, forms of nitrogen, and phosphorus) were also determined. It was found that the rhizospheric microbiome (at the genus level) of cv. Hondia and Rotax were significantly different from that present in the other cultivars studied. The CLPP technique demonstrated that microbial metabolic activity depended on both the type of substrate and wheat cultivars. Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids were the most easily utilized compounds in all rhizospheric soils. The principal component analysis (PCA) evidenced that the rhizospheric soils of Rotax and Nordkap were characterized by a higher functional activity (strong correlation with the Shannon-Wiener index, the Richness index, and utilization of hydrocarbons) than those of Hondia and Tytanika.},

   abstract = {Soil texture is an essential component of soil survey for estimating potentials and limitations of land use and management. It has been appreciated as an important predictor for numerous soil processes. However, its connections with the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community remain less understood. This work employed a marker gene high-throughput sequencing approach to determine soil texture-based patterns of bacterial and fungal distribution. Thirty-six intact soil cores were sampled from bermudagrass ecosystems across seven soil texture classes with sand fraction varying from 30.3 to 83.4% and clay fraction from 4.4 to 53.0%. These soil cores were arranged into three sets of equal numbers, and each set of 12 was subjected to three moisture regimes (dry spell, field moisture, and saturation-field capacity), respectively, for 15 days. Soil cores were further stratified into top and bottom sections, leading to a total of 72 samples with varying soil physical and chemical properties. Our data revealed that fungal alpha diversity was more strongly related to soil texture than bacterial alpha diversity, with fungal species richness and Shannon diversity being positively correlated with the sand fraction. Soil texture was the second most important factor after soil pH in shaping the soil microbial community. Relative abundances of some fungi (Basidiomycota and Eurotiomycetes) and filamentous bacteria (Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi) significantly increased with silt and/or clay content. The genetic potential for the degradation of organic compounds also appeared to be higher in finer textured soils than the coarse-textured soils. By identifying sand, silt or clay-preferred microbial taxa and characterizing mineral particle-dependent genetic potential of organic carbon degradation and nitrogen cycling, this work highlighted the significance of soil texture and texture-associated pores, and resource locality, in regulating microbial diversity and community composition.},

Agricultural activities reduced the variation of the microbial communities, however, its influence was local and much less than the overall influence of soil properties.

   abstract = {Climate change has a devastating effect on wheat production; therefore, crop production might decline by 2030. Phosphorus (P) nutrient deficiency is another main limiting factor of reduced yield. Hence, there is a dire need to judiciously consider wheat yield, so that human requirements and nutrition balance can be sustained efficiently. Despite the great significance of biostimulants in sustainable agriculture, there is still a lack of integrated technology encompassing the successful competitiveness of inoculated phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) in agricultural systems in the context of climatic conditions/meteorological factors and soil nutritional status. Therefore, the present study reveals the modulation of an integrated P nutrient management approach to develop potential PSB consortia for recommended wheat varieties by considering the respective soil health and agro-climatic conditions. The designed consortia were found to maintain adequate viability for up to 9 months, verified through field emission scanning electron microscopy and viable count. Furthermore, a significant increase in grain yield (5%–8%) and seed P (4%) content was observed in consortia-inoculated wheat plants with 20% reduced Diammonium phosphate (DAP) application under net house conditions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of roots and amplification of the gcd gene of Ochrobactrum sp. SSR indicated the survival and rhizosphere competency of the inoculated PSB. Categorical principal component analysis (CAT-PCA) showed a positive correlation of inoculated field-grown wheat varieties in native soils to grain yield, soil P content, and precipitation for sites belonging to irrigated plains and seed P content, soil organic matter, and number of tillers for sites belonging to Northern dry mountains. However, the impact of inoculation at sites belonging to the Indus delta was found significantly correlated to soil potassium (K) content, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature. Additionally, a significant increase in grain yield (15%) and seed P (14%) content was observed in inoculated wheat plants. Thus, the present study demonstrates for the first time the need to integrate soil biological health and agro-climatic conditions for consistent performance of augmented PSB and enhanced P nutrient uptake to curtail soil pollution caused by the extensive use of agrochemicals. This study provides innovative insights and identifies key questions for future research on PSB to promote its successful implementation in agriculture.},

How soil texture (Texture) and presence or lack of root hairs (Root Hair) of plants affect the rhizosphere microbiome assembly and soil potential extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) at defined rooting depth (Depth) is still a knowledge gap. We investigated effects of these drivers on microbial assembly in rhizosphere and on potential EEA in root-affected soil of maize. Methods: Samples were taken from three depths of root hair defective mutant rth3 and wild-type WT maize planted on loam and sand in soil columns after 22 days. Rhizosphere bacterial, archaeal, fungal and cercozoan communities were analysed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, ITS and 18S rRNA gene fragments. Soil potential EEA of ß-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and chitinase were estimated using fluorogenic substrates. Results: The bacterial, archaeal and cercozoan alpha- and beta-diversities were significantly and strongly altered by Texture, followed by Depth and Root Hair. Texture and Depth had a small impact on fungal assembly, and only fungal beta-diversity was significantly affected. Significant impacts by Depth and Root Hair on beta-diversity and relative abundances at taxonomic levels of bacteria, archaea, fungi and cercozoa were dependent on Texture. Likewise, the patterns of potential EEA followed the trends of microbial communities, and the potential EEA correlated with the relative abundances of several taxa. Conclusions: Texture was the strongest driver of rhizosphere microbiome and of soil potential EEA, followed by Depth and Root Hair, similarly to findings in maize root architecture and plant gene expression studies.},

In contrast, B. thuringiensis could be found in sand-based soil while it is not found in silt texture. Our data also demonstrated that there are no significant changes in stress response between the two groups however, differential physiological changes in plants inoculated with silt and sand based bacterial isolates have been observed.

   abstract = {Selected fungi from a take-all suppressive wheat field in Montana were characterized morphologically and identified as Phialophora spp. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from four Phialophora spp. and two known Gaeumannomyces isolates were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence comparison of the rDNA ITS regions revealed that these Phialophora isolates were not closely related to Gaeummanomyces sp. Alignment of the ITS sequences allowed the design of PCR primers that distinguished the Phialophora isolates from Gaeummanomyces sp. as well as Phialophora sp. related to Gaeummanomyces. Phialophora sp. 1-52 and Phialophora sp. 1-58 were tested alone and in combination for suppression of Gaeumannomycesgraminis var. tritici in the field. When introduced on autoclaved canola seed, 1-52 proved to be an efficient biological control agent against wheat take-all disease in its original suppressive soil, as well as in a highly conducive soil. Isolate 1-58 did not provide protection in the suppressive soil, but did in two other soils, including the conducive soil. Protection was expressed as increased seedling dry weight, decreased root disease scores on mature plants, and increased grain yield as compared with the nonprotected check treatment in one of the two test years. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
