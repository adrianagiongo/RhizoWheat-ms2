## Abstract
Continuous wheat cropping often leads to yield decline, with suspected causes including increased pathogen susceptibility, decreased root growth, or low nutrient use efficiency, though the exact cause remains unknown. Here, we investigated soil and root-associated bacterial and archaeal communities in wheat under rotation versus continuous cultivation, monitored fungal pathogen presence, and used beneficial bacteria to mitigate symptoms induced by Gaeumannomyces tritici (Ggt) in greenhouse experiments. Sampling was conducted at two field sites with different soil textures over two years and at two plant developmental stages, capturing site-specific and seasonal fluctuations. A total of 767 isolates were screened for plant-beneficial traits, with 460 identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Amplicon sequencing revealed minor effects on community structure due to wheat rotational position but pronounced effects related to site, year, and microhabitat. Rhizoplane isolates with plant-beneficial traits were mainly Flavobacterium, Microbacterium, Pedobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Variovorax. Continuous wheat rotations showed the highest proportion of bacteria with fungal antagonistic potential, indicating plant roots’ recruitment of functionally active bacteria. Introducing Ggt in the greenhouse experiment altered the microbiome, confirming field study results and demonstrating that applying beneficial bacteria at the right time and place can control Ggt and improve plant growth. This study highlights the dynamic nature of wheat's below-ground bacterial and archaeal community, influenced by soil type, season, and microhabitat, with wheat rotation playing a minor role. However, it confirms the potential of selected Bacillus and Pseudomonas, whether used individually or in consortia, for microbe-assisted soil amelioration in intensive wheat production.
